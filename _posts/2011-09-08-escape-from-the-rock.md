# Guersnsey to Alderney

*Anchored at Braye, Alderney* ![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img_1324-sml_scale.jpg)

Five nights at St Peter Port was enough.  For me, more than enough, but bad weather had kept me firmly but safely tied up in the QE2 marina.

But Thursday was not quite so bad, so off I went.  I would have liked to have gone to Cherbourg, but it would have meant arriving in the dark between 10 and midnight.  Whilst I don't mind, quite like even sailing in the dark, I don't like doing so close to land, or arriving in the dark, so opted instead to go to Alderney where I could arrive in time for a civilised dinner.

Conditions didn't seem too bad in the marina, but got progressively worse quite quickly.

The biggest problem was visibility, or to more accurate, the lack of it. Nevertheless, I felt I'd started so I'd finish.  Up went the sails, on went the radar, and White Angel headed North West.  Winds picked up, and I was soon down to 2 reefs and a partly furled foresail.  But it was ok, as even though the wind sometimes exceeded 30 knots (F7) it was a following wind, so not too bad.  In a similar vein the calm'ish seas outside the marina gave way to more lively seas once I'd cleared Guernsey, but nothing exceptional.

Arriving at Alderney was perhaps both the highlight and lowlight.  The highlight, was that its good to arrive and break out those essential nutritional supplies of gin and tonic. The lowlight, rounding Alderney brought me heading directly into the very strong winds and crashing waves for the last few miles, and visibility so low that when I entered the harbour, I still couldn't see the other yachts already moored to buoys.

I decided to anchor off the beach rather than join the other boats.  I believe it's ½ price to anchor, so better value, but also it allowed me to be able to run my petrol generator without worrying about disturbing others.   In practice, it turned out to be even better value, as I wasn't charged.
