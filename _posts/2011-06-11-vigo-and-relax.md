# Bayona to Vigo

*Vigo - a birds eye view*

[![Vigo]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/Vigo.jpg)](http://digicasts.org/whiteangel/2012/12/vigo-and-relax/vigo/)This is not the greatest or most exciting trip, but was in fact a pleasant slow sail, drift almost, in warm sunshine , from Bayona near the mouth of the Ria de Vigo to Vigo itself. It was just about 10nm, and we managed to cope without even adopting a watch pattern.

The Ria seems very quiet compared to previous visits, but I guess it changes in July/August.

 

We got to the marina, whose entrance hides behind a commercial ferry departure point, and was not obvious, but we found it.

The intent had been to re-fuel and stay a few days. Sadly the single space fuelling point was full and already had a 2nd boat rafting, so we were directed to a berth.

This marina has a Mediterranean style berthing with no individual pontoons. Rather, one reverses towards, and ties up to, a long pontoon, and picks up a line that is anchored in front of the boat to secure the front end.

Of course Murphy's law comes into play at this point, as the wind decided to pick up, and whilst not strong was a solid F4 on the beam.

This made the berthing tricky, not helped by only being 2 of us, nor that one of us had never experienced or even heard of this berthing style and the other (me) only thought he knew what he doing. The boat ended up at a fetching diagonal angle at one point, which was not quite what I think was intended. Nevertheless, following much heaving, straining and sweating over ropes, we got securely berthed with no damage. So I claim an inelegant success.

As we started to relax and think meaningfully of the cold beers in the fridge, we were told (I'm guessing a bit here as I don't speak Spanish nor did the marina man speak inglesé) that it was a temporary berth whilst we waited for fuel and we couldn't stay there. So lucky us, we got to practice berthing a 2nd time when we moved to another berth at which we could rest for a few days. Not quite so inelegant the 2nd time, but no gold stars either. But the beers were indeed cold.

The weather is great now, but not ideal sailing weather, with very light winds, but sunny and warm. The winds have also crept around to the south which is where I'm headed, so I'm wondering whether to stay to wait for the northerlies, or make slower progress south. But in the meantime, Vigo is a great city to visit, with lots of bars to relax and 'people watch', so no rush.

So will my next blog be from some obscure spot in the Ria de Vigo, or will it be somewhere in Portugal? Who can say? Me I guess. But I won't for now... :)
