# Roscanvel to Brest

*Brest ![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img_1295-sml_scale.jpg)

Today was short trip to the new marina in Brest.  Open about a year I think, and no shortage of space.

I spent a few days in Brest restocking the boat with food, fuel, gas, and did the boring things like laundry.

The marina staff were really friendly and helpful.  When I asked about camping gaz, it turns out the nearest stockist was about 6kn away at the other marina outside Brest called Moulin Blanc.  But this was not a problem, as they simply drove me over there to get it.  The kindness continued.  When we arrived at about 12.40, the stockist was literally shutting the doors as they close at 12.30 for lunch.  But after minimal pleading, they re-opened into their already shortened lunch break and sold me a refilled gas bottle.
