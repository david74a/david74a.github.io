# A Coruna to Cedeira

*Cedeira* ![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img_1142---sml_scale.jpg)

There are so many lovely sunsets here, so I thought I'd share another one from my Cedeira anchorage.  I also shared it with a most welcome ice cold G&T with ice and lemon of course (now the fridge is back on form) accompanied by Portugese olives.

Saturday was the day to refuel and leave Coruna in bright sunshine.  The winds were forecast to be moderate, albeit in the wrong direction, so off I went.

As has often been the case, the winds were stronger than forecast, and stayed a solid F5-6 all the way, so a 7 hour slog tacking to Cedeira. But the sunshine helped, and there was little swell, and the seas more choppy than rough, so I was able to prepare lunch and have the odd coffee.  I'd hate to think what it's like when a F6 is forecast.

Cedeira is a lovely anchorage, with no swell, and surprisingly comfortable in the strong winds that I anchored in.  To look on the bright side, it'll give my wind charger some exercise.

At one point I heard some voices that had been carried by the wind to the boat.  Perhaps from another boat, possibly the beach?  But no, when I popped into the cockpit, there was a pedalo with 4 people on it about 3 foot from the boat.  I think we were equally surprised with each other.

The forecast remains reasonably favourable, so despite the temptation to get the dinghy out and explore ashore, I'll aim to press on further east tomorrow.
