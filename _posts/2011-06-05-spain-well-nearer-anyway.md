# Falmouth to Cameret

*Cameret - under the influence of a 'grande creme'* [![cameret]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/cameret.jpg)](http://digicasts.org/whiteangel/2012/12/spain-well-nearer-anyway/cameret/)

Well I still don't know where we'll be in 4 or 5 days time, but if the last post had asked where in about 1 to 2 days time, the answer would be Cameret, which is near Brest on the tip of Brittany.

After all the preparation and excitement of 'the big trip', the weather didn't play fair and delivered an anti-climax of about 10 hours motoring from Falmouth, after which the wind started to pick up, but was pretty much dead astern, so not great sailing. White Angel has a fuel tank of about 130 litres, which is a dull point by itself. But of more significance is that 130 litres is not enough to motor across Biscay in the unlikely event of being becalmed, but would get about 2/3 of the way across. So I decided a visit to la belle France was in order to ensure we started across Biscay with a full tank of fuel.

When some wind eventually arrived, we were able to set course for L'Aberwrach.  This was not really ideal as it didn't make progress south, but at least we could sail. But then the weather gods cast a friendly and helpful eye on us, and increased the wind a bit, and changed direction so we could head further south.

Cameret was the obvious choice, but the direct route would have taken us through the Chenel du Four which has very strong tides and needs to be entered at a certain time in relation to tides. Sadly our estimated arrival time at the Chenel du Four would have been out by some 5-6 hrs, so I tried a new route for me, and set course to pass outside of the Chenel but inside of the Ile de Ouessant.

At this point the weather gods were either getting bored, of had decided we were having too easy a time of it, so the winds piped up to a F6, gusting F7, sometimes just touching F8. But it was a following wind, and the seas not too rough, so reducing sail to eventually just a part furled foresail made it ok.

We arrived at Cameret at about 5 pm after about 22½ hrs, refuelled and managed to get a berth on the inside marina which allowed an easy walk to town after some well deserved gin and tonics and a shower.

My steak ashore was excellent, though its just as well I'm comfortable with lightly cooked meat! Marty claimed his somewhat disgusting looking pizza was equally good. I wasn't convinced. On returning to the boat it was straight to sleep, and I suspect a tornado would not have woken us. It was clearly the exhaustion of the long trip, though a cynic may suspect the influence of gin and tonics and a bottle of decent French wine....

Well, we'll set off again about 14.00 BST, so where next?
