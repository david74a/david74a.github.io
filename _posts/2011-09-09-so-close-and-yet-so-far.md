# Alderney to Cherbourg

*Cherbourg* ![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img_1330-sml_scale.jpg)

You just never know who your neighbours will be - the Queen Mary leaving after popping into Cherbourg to view White Angel.

It was a bit rolly at anchor in Alderney, but no worse than some of the others on the trip.

The visibility improved enough in the morning for the photo in the last entry, and by the afternoon was pretty good.  Sailing in this area is governed by the tides, so an afternoon departure was in order.

It was an uneventful sail, crossing the top of the notorious Alderney Race with light but favourable winds.  There was an occasional fog patch, but thankfully nothing that lingered.  There seemed to be very few lobster pots and no other boats.

At 6.00 pm I tied up in Cherbourg where there was no shortage of spaces. Uncharacteristically, despite having an audience I managed a perfect park.  I wanted to applaud myself, but thought the audience may not approve, and doubt my mental health.

I later learned that most of the visiting boats had been there for at least a week due to the weather.  Given the forecast, and promise of leftover hurricanes from the other side of the Atlanic, it looks like I won't be leaving quickly myself.

So close and yet so far......
