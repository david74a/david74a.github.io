# Leixoes to Viano do Castelo

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/imag0220_scale.jpg)

Thursday, and time to leave Leixoes and keep pressing on northwards. I'd promised myself longer than an overnight stop at Viana do Castelo as I wanted to explore the very pretty town a little more and ride their funicular railway to the very prominent church high above the town which is visible for miles around.

I left about 11.00, and arrived at Viano about 6.00 pm. It was a 50:50 split between motoring and sailing, but sunbathing was definitely included.  I logged about 40 nm doing the 32 nm trip, largely thanks to the everlasting southerly current.

Berthing at the waiting pontoon should have been straightforward, but was not helped by an Irish boat just in front of me berthing somewhat inconsiderately, and leaving me a gap to get into rather than them taking the next place and allow me to berth behind them.  Their help with my lines was also, how can I put this politely, sub-optimal. Still, I got parked with no damage and only lightly frayed nerves.

Sadly my day's sightseeing on the Friday didn't happen as planned. Uncharacteristically, it was a miserable rainy day, all day.  The 1st I've experienced in quite some time now.  I decided to stay yet another day to do my funicular trip.

My extra, extra day turned out to have some silver linings.  I did indeed find my way to the funicular railway, rode to the church and spectacular views.  But I also found a new, large and modern, shopping complex.  Here I was able to buy a new external wi-fi adapter with a high gain arial for just €22.  Marina wi-fi access has been flaky at best, and I figured this should help.  The marine equivalent is over £100.

But the biggest treat was that in the evening there was a Celtic music show, complete with large stage, great sound system, fancy lighting and 2 huge monitors either side of the stage.  The town had a real buzz to it, despite the white rather than tartan bagpipes  (I wasn't expecting that in Portugal!!!).
