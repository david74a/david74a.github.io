# Brest to l'Aberbendoit

*l'Aberbendoit* ![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img_1301-sml_scale.jpg)

Monday 29th August, a bank holiday for some, but a normal day for me.  Time to move on, or the keel might get stuck.

The forecast was for light west to north west winds, veering overnight to north east.  I decided to head for Ouessant as I figured I would enjoy the sail, and I'd never been there.  There was also talk of free mooring buoys.

However, it was not to be.  The wind never materialised in sufficient strength to sail.  When I exited the Rade de Brest, I realised the timing was right to navigate the Chenel du Four.  A rock strewn passage around the coast that has very strong tides and can be rough.  I took advantage of the timing and continued through the Chenel du Four to l'Aberbendoit under engine.

l'Aberbendoit is an estuary next door to the better known l'Aberwrach estuary, but quieter.  It's a tricky entrance, but made easy with a chart plotter and GPS.  It's also very picturesque and for me, ideal as a rest stop before pushing on homewards.

Night time however, it took on a different complexion.  It was dark in the night, virtually black as there was no moon.  I heard wolves howling in the trees nearby, quite an eerie sound when one is alone in the blackness.  I reassured myself that whilst wolves may be able to swim, I doubted they could drop the boarding ladder and clamber on board.

Apart from that a pleasant and relaxing evening, and a good night sleep despite the strong tides whooshing past the hull.
