# Figueira de Foz to Aveiro and Sao Jactim

*Sao Jactim* ![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/_s_saojactim02a_scale.jpg)

I think it's fair to say the marina at Figueira de Foz is

a\) not the most efficient in the world - it's fine to be relaxed, but too near the horizontal is not so good

b\) not the best value at €30 per night

c\) the best value marina on the Portuguese coast

The Monday forecast was relatively good for a north going boat in a land of prevailing northerlies.  It was about a F4/5 with a hint of westerly added to the northerly wind, with low swell.  So I decided to set off at about 09.00 for the 32 nm trip to Aveiro.  The timing matters as there is a small'ish recommended window for Aveiro, with reported ebb tides of up to 8 knots.

Unfortunately the marina staff had other ideas.  The office opens at 08.30, and I needed to pay and return the door token to recover my deposit.  By 10.00 I was becoming a little 'tense' as there was no sign of the marina office opening.  I set off, but then had to re-berth at the reception pontoon where the customs people cover the marina role out of office hours.  The helpful man there returned my deposit, but said they don't take any money, and if the marina was not open, that was they're fault and I should just go.

Not one to ignore authority, I set off on my way, €60 better off.  Such good value that marina.

The trip to Aveiro felt a long sail, actually covering over 42 nm thanks mainly to the foul current.  I went in as close as I dared, arguably even closer.  At one point, as I wondering if I could recognise the vegetation on the sand dunes, with the background noise of breakers on the beach, I decided perhaps I was getting a little too close in and got a bit more sea room.

I arrived at Aveiro in the right time window, despite the best attempts of the Fog de Foz marina to subvert my plans, and had a 4 knot tide pushing me upstream at just over 10 knots.

I anchored at Sao Jactim and enjoyed the lack of swell as the lagoon is effectively inshore, just a little movement occasionally from passing small boats and the ferry.  My G&T with the setting sun felt well deserved.  Off tomorrow, north once more.
