# Perros Guirec to Guernsey

*Havelet Bay, St Peter Port, Guernsey ![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img_1320-sml_scale.jpg)*

After a rest, and letting the winds die down a bit for the longer trip of about 60 nm to Guernsey, I set off once more on the first Saturday morning of September.

It was a nice day, but little wind was forecast, nevertheless, once more I pointed the boat at the tiny marina entrance/exit, shut my eyes, and hey presto, when I opened them I was out.  Well I exaggerate a tad, but it's how it felt.  In fact the gap was 6m, allowing a 1.1m gap either side for me, or about 0.8m gap either side with fenders down.

I motored for the first few hours, but was then lucky enough to get a favourable wind for about 4 hrs, which eventually died away leaving me under Volvo power once more.

I arrived before there was enough water to get into the marina, so anchored in Havelet Bay, next to St Peter Port for a couple of hours, before going to St Peter Port visitor marina to get customs papers and then on to the QE2 marina for the night.  White Angel is a little too deep for the visitor marina.  The last part was in the dark. Whilst I'm quite happy sailing at night at sea, I hate doing so near land with lobster pots every ready to catch the unwary.

I would normally have stayed at anchor overnight and gone in the next day, but the weather gods were threatening unpleasantness, so I decided to play safe.  The gods lived up to their forecast, with gales in the channel for several days, keeping me in Guernsey for 5 days until Thursday.

I like Guernsey, and enjoy visiting it for a day or two, but having been here so many times in the past, a day or two is enough, so I'm looking forward to moving on despite the tides being less than convenient.
