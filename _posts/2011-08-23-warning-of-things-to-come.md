# Concarneau to St Evette (Near Audierne)

*At Anchor St Evette* ![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/st-evette-01-sml_scale.jpg)

John came down to see me off, and make my departure easier as I squeezed out between the pontoon and neighbouring boat, with our fenders gently kissing as I slid out.  I suppose that should be French kissing.

Going west along this coast is often hard work, and this trip was no exception.  For the first half it was tacking to get past the Point de Penmarch, dodging the various rocks and multitude of cardinal markers in moderate winds and choppy seas, then, as I came off the wind, a faster run to complete the 47 nm trip to St Evette.  It was not helped by a grey sky and steely looking seas, but was a painful reminder of what is to come as I return to the chilly not-blue waters of the UK and the Solent.

It does seem as if Paris has returned home.  There were far fewer boats around, and at St Evette which is a mix of anchorage and visitor buoys, had several buoys free.  Quite a contrast to my last visit here in July last year when they were all full.  I anchored just in case the buoys weren't strong enough, or could it be that anchoring is free whereas the buoys are not?

St Evette seems the natural stopping of point before navigating the dreaded Raz de Sein, whether going east, west or even north.  It's at the mouth of a river leading north to the pleasant town of Audierne which can only be accessed 1-2 hours either side of high water.  Though St Evette never seems to be a place people go ashore, despite seeming attractive enough. I must have been here 6 to 8 times, and have never been ashore.  Maybe next time.

A restful evening and night but I felt the need to run the boat heating for a couple of hours before retiring.  Another reminder of what's to come.......
