# Nazaré

Thursday, another day of brilliant sunshine.   A bit windy, but hot.

With thanks to my friend John for patching up the bike, it was a cycling day.  I delved into deep dark recesses of my locker to dig out my folding bike.  It's 6 speed, aluminium, with suspension, and snaps into shape with just 2 fastenings.  I think it sounds great.  Sadly it was made in China, and has that quality feel of Chinese goods before they became the factory of the world.  But it works - just.

It was a festival day in Portugal, celebrating some saint or other.  But nevertheless, off I went to visit the town of Nazaré, probably about 2 miles away, had I not taken the by-pass and made it more like 6.  Still, I suppose exercise is good for me, and I'm sure I made a fine site wobbling along on my shiny aluminium bike, marginally faster than walking, and perspiring enough to water an average size garden, as I cycled up the hill by-passing the town.

The town is clearly a seaside resort, though not I suspect in any Thompson's brochure.  It had a very pleasant feel to it and an avuncular railway you might spot in one of the photos in the gallery for Nazaré. I didn't ride it, but was told the views are spectacular from the top.

What I did do though was have my first taste of sardines, a fairly traditional dish for Portugal, and I have to say it was a good experience.  The meal was at a small restaurant with photos of the food outside for simpletons like me who don't speak the language.  The photo above, was the actual meal, which I thought unusually, looked slightly better than the restaurant photo.

The festival included a religious march, and a band.  What more could one ask for.

Having learnt my lesson I cycled back the direct route in less than half the time, and put the bike away ready for tomorrow's departure to places new.
