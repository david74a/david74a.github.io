*Biscay Weather*

The planned 14.00 became 15.00. Why? Because I don't like the rain. Amazing isn't it, over 20 years of messing about on sailing boats, and I don't like getting wet. When the rain had eased we slipped the lines and slipped out of a quiet Cameret, the only boat dumb enough to go anywhere.

We had an easy and gentle passage to the notorious Raz de Sein, and thankfully got through with no drama. The Raz de Sein is the very western most tip of Brittany, and the start of Biscay. The water gets channelled around the headland, and at times runs very fast between the headland and the nearby Isle de Sein, and the waters can be dangerously turbulent.

Into Biscay filled with excitement and fear. Will this be an easy gentle cruise with cooked breakfasts and G&T at sundown, playing with dolphins in the day, or a ride of terror clinging on whilst the boat is buffeted by strong winds and huge seas? You never know at this point.

The winds duly picked up to around a F6 gusting to a near gale F7, and the waves increased their size. However, it was a following wind and with 2 reefs in the main and a partly furled foresail we made excellent progress. Our speed peaked at over 9 knots, but was mostly around 7-8 knots for quite a long time.

During the trip there we were visited by 2 pilot whales, and numerous dolphins which is always great for morale. A couple of dolphins kindly posed for a photo.

The 1st night came and went. Not really a great time with blackness all around. There were times when the sea and sky just merged together into a single all encompassing blackness which was not very pleasant. We had an encounter with a large container ship that changed course towards us, then (I think/guess) realised we were there, and shone their searchlight in our direction from perhaps a mile away, flashing it a few times. I dug out our searchlight and did likewise also illuminating the sail. The ship changed course and passed safely behind us.

The next 'fun' was as we passed over the continental shelf, with the depth of water increasing quickly from about 180m to 800m and then to whatever the depth of the Atlantic is. The seas were rougher over this part. During this time we spotted a bright light and a flashing light, which feels very strange when you are miles from anywhere. Then more flashing lights and another bright light was spotted. It turned out to be 3 trawlers. They were in our way, and I did not want to risk going between them, so a big turn off course was called for. It took a couple of hours to get away from them keeping us longer on the rougher waters of the edge of the continental shelf. Finally we got back on course and continued.

Dawn broke, and brought some welcome sunshine and warming, as it can get quite cold at night even in June despite us wearing multiple layers of clothing, with thermal base layers. The winds dropped to a 5-6, and on we rolled. We were heading for the NW tip of Spain to give us the option of going A Coruna or continuing around the tip of NW Spain going south.

The next night came and went, but included some very fickle weather with some rainy squalls and variable winds that had us putting reefs in and out, and adjusting sails repeatedly over a few hours in the dark. Not great fun and exhausting.

Fortunately, and with unerring consistency, dawn broke and on we went. The weather settled and we continued to make good progress. As we got to within about 80 nm of A Coruna, with no recent weather forecast, we changed course for A Coruna. Then about 20 nm offshore the magic of the internet became available, and the latest weather forecast looked good to continue.

What a choice, after two nights at sea, we could get into A Coruna for about 10.00 pm UK time, or could we face another night at sea and take advantage of the good forecast to get past Finnisterre and the reassuringly (!)  named 'Costa del Morte'. Or 'Coast of Death' in English. I've passed this bit of coast before and have sampled it being benign and also with the strongest winds and biggest seas I've ever experienced, so exploiting the good forecast won.

Night three came and the wind died away and up went the iron sail, or in simpler English, we put the engine on.  In the daytime, that would not be a problem, nor would it be a problem at night if far offshore. But with the shore in sight, there is always the risk of lobster pots which cannot be easily seen at night and which could get tangled around our propeller, so motoring along in the relatively calm seas was not quite as restful as it might have been.

As we were passing Finnisterre, we had our next bit of 'fun', as a lot of small white lights appeared and our course was to go between them. These turned out to be small local fishing boats, and there seemed to be about a hundred of them. However, there were actually only about 15, but they seemed a lot. The problem with these boats is that with only a single white navigation light it was not possible to know which way they were travelling. But we got through with just one near miss.

Dawn came with another good weather day, though little wind so the engine that had worked hard for the last several hours continued its work..

*Approaching Bayona*

We continued to the Ria de Vigo, and finally tied up in Bayona just 2 hours short of 3 days at sea, covering 447 nm. We were tired!
