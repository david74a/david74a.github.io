# Ile Dumet to Piriac Sur Mer

![Piriac Sur Mer]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img_1231-sml_scale.jpg)

A pipe smoking mademoiselle - not something you see every day.

The exposed anchorage worked fine for me and 3 other boats, but I wouldn't want to be there in unsettled weather.

The pilot book talked of boats going aground on the approach to Piriac marina due to uncharted obstacles.  So undeterred, but cautious, I wanted to enter the marina near high water.  This meant getting up at the crack of dawn quite literally, and I had the benefit of seeing the sun rise as I motored the 4 nm to Piriac enjoying that most special first cuppa of the day.

I was in before the marina staff, and tied up to the labelled visitor berth and then took myself to another berth.  But this was not to the liking of the marina staff when they eventually turned up, and I was directed to move to a different vacant berth.  Fortunately the wind was in a convenient direction, and so the move to the smaller berth was trouble free.  The new berth is also more sheltered, so no complaints.

The charge was less than anticipated, though at €33 still not cheap. Sadly the days of free wiifi seem to have passed.  But at €9.90 for a day, I thought the wifi here excessively expensive, especially compared the €3 for 3 days at La Rochelle.

Piriac turned out to be a pleasant town that has an old world feel to it, despite being very popular with tourists.  I indulged in moule frites and a traditional bowl of cider, which turned out to be excellent.

The evening had a buzz to it too, with some street performers, including fire dancing/eating.
