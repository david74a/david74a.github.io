# Peniche to Figueira de Foz

*Figueira de Foz* ![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/market_scale.jpg)

Saturday arrived, I'd like to say I was rested, but the anchorage wasn't as settled as I'd like, so I was still a bit tired, but it was a good forecast to carry on with winds being N-NW, and my destination of Figueira de Foz was NE once I'd cleared th e1st headland.  Not a forecast to missed when heading north and facing a 50 nm trip.

The trip was pleasantly uneventful.  I motor sailed about the 1st half, and sailed the last half on flat seas with no perceptible swell, even lounging on deck sunbathing at times.

Arriving meant the irritation of having to tie up at a reception pontoon, have the same papers they examined a couple weeks looked at again, and more forms completed.  Then, cast off and onto a marina berth. It wasn't the easiest of parks, being blown off, small fingers on the pontoon, and not a huge amount of space.  But thanks to some shoreside help it went fine with no embarrassment or scrapes.

Back in Fig de Foz I wanted to revisit the marina Tapas bar where I'd had the best meal I'd had in Portugal on the way down.  I was joined this time by George and Rachel a lovely couple from Yorks and Brum respectively who have embarked on the great adventure of buying their 1st boat (a 45' Sun Oddessey), to live on and sail from Hartlepool to the Mediterranean for as long as they enjoy it.   I greatly admire their spirit, and wish them well for their trip.  In fact I'd spotted their boat in Bayona on the way down, but they had stayed much longer to relax after the trip from Hartlepool.

Having joined me for dinner on my recommendation, it was a relief the food was up the same excellent standard, and a good evening was had by all.

The next day (today) is a Sunday - so that must mean a day of rest.  And that's what I did - mostly.  I made a trip to the small local supermarket but I didn't fancy their fresh stuff.  So I followed that by a visit to the excellent local market, very gaily decorated I thought. There I got some fresh bread and lettuce.  Then the big one.  I wanted some flesh, so steeled myself and found a butchers, went in, and managed to procure myself some chicken.  With no English on 1 side and no Portuguese on the other,  but with flapping of arms like chicken wings, I resisted clucking, it was quite an achievement. The word is not pollo like Spanish, but is apparently Frango.  That I'd never have guessed.

Weather permitting, tomorrow should see me tacking north once more.
