Povoa de Varzin to Leixoes

*Leixoes Port [![leixoes-02]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/leixoes-02.jpg)](http://digicasts.org/whiteangel/2012/12/sailing-again/leixoes-02/)*

Sailing again.  I think I was developing what long term cruisers call "sticky keel".  It was all to easy to just relax in the pleasant and relaxing environment of Povoa de Varzim, but that would miss the opportunity to explore new places.

It was a lovely day Saturday, and a moderate northerly wind blew me gently towards Leixoes.  Don't even think of trying to pronounce Leixois, because unless you're born in Portugal, or have lived here for more than 10 years, speaking the language fluently, you can't!

Leixoes is a commercial port outside of Porto, but has a small marina and the benefit of being accessible at all states of the tide, and in all but the very worst weather.

Of course the gentle winds were giving me way to easy a time of it, and as I neared Leixoes, they piped up to a strong F6.  I found myself on collision course with a rather large ship also entering the harbour, and whilst steam gives way to sail, size really does count, so I furled away the foresail to slow down and let the big guy go first - pretending I had a choice.

As the ship got near to the port entrance, it got caught by the swell, and starting rolling from side to side as it entered.  Great, I thought, if it does that to a large ship what's it going to do to a small plastic boat?

Curiously, I didn't experience the same rolling, so I guess it must be related to distance between the waves that didn't suit the ship.

I got to the marina, and was directed to a pontoon suitable for a boat about 10' shorter than White Angel, with the wind blowing on the beam.  Still, I got in with both the help and hindrance of the man at the marina.  But it was to be a short stay, as I was keen to explore new places, and Leixoes (remember - you really can't pronounce it) was the furthest South I'd been before.
