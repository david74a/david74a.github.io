Today is the day I should have been doing my final preparations and provisioning for the 3 month adventure towards Spain and Portugal. Tomorrow was departure day. Sadly, fate had other plans.....

A few weeks ago, White Angel was lifted ashore for her annual maintenance, scrub and anti-foul. Unfortunately, or fortunately (depending on whether you're a glass 1/2 full or 1/2 empty kind of person), a crack was spotted in the mast. Most agreed this new 'feature' was not advantageous, or desirable for any sailing, and especially not sailing that included a Biscay crossing, so plans had to change.

A new mast was duly ordered, and is today sitting in Chichester waiting for the rigger to confirm when work may start, which includes new riggng given the old girl celebrated her 10th birthday this year. Next Monday is the provsional date, which I hope will enable departure on the voyage of discovery the following week.

It will be good to be afloat if only motoring the boat to Chichester, having had great weather over the last few weeks, matched with great frustration at not being able to use the boat for sailing. On the plus side, my house has benefitted from a long overdue staining of the windowframes, with no less than 3 coats. It takes a broken boat for that to happen.

Fingers crossed next Monday goes ahead.
