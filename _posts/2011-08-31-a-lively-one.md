# Morgueriec to Perros Guirec

*en route ![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img_1305-sml_scale.jpg)*

Given the super strong tides, there was little point in an early departure, so it wasn't until 2.30 I upped anchor and away.

The winds were East-North East, co-incidently the same way I wanted to go.  But there was little option.  It was either stay in the anchorage to wait for the more suitable winds that were forecast for several days later, or grit my teeth, gird my loins, and all the other clichés you might think of, and brave the elements.

The winds were forecast to be a F5-6, and the sea state rough to very rough.  It didn't disappoint, with the winds actually peaking at the lower end of F7 at 32 knots.   I tacked and battered my way for 9 hrs to Perros Guirec.

There were no other boats out. I wonder why?

The marina at Perros Guirec has a very narrow tidal window of usually just an hour before High Water to an hour after.  But by some lucky fluke I arrived around dusk, at an ideal time of 15 mins or so before high water.  To illustrate quite how narrow the window gets, when there is a neap tide, it is not possible to enter or leave the marina for about 4 days.  So I'd better watch how long I stay.

The entrance to the marina is also very narrow, arguably the narrowest I've ever used.  It was both a sucking of teeth and butt clenching moment as I pointed the boat at the gap, shut my eyes and hoped for the best.   Motoring through the gap with stone walls either side, it felt as if my fenders might touch on both sides, but somehow, I slid safely in.

The marina was very sheltered though, and I parked without drama.
