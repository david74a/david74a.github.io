# Ile d'Yeu to Ile de Noirmoutier

*Port de Morin – Ile de Noirmoutier ![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img_1212-sml_scale.jpg)*

At €36 per night, one night was enough, so come Tuesday morning; there was time for a visit to Dick and Ginger who had arrived that morning, and a visit to the now open Supermarché.

The tides meant an early or late departure, and I opted for casting off the lines at 15.00.  Then there was an easy and relaxed 20 nm sail in sunshine and a swimming costume, to an anchorage outside Port Morin on the Ile de Noirmoutier.

I was a bit concerned as there was barely enough water for the boat according to the charts, and access was only possible at certain states of the tide to what was effectively a sort of pool, with rocks below the surface around the pool on 3 sides, and a beach on the other.  But there was more water than expected, and the anchorage worked well, despite, like so many others, feeling very exposed.  But it was just for the one night.
