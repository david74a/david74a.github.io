> **Lorient to Concarneau

This is what a sun clock looks like at night in Concarneau

Time to continue westwards and homewards. Come Monday 22 August, I set off once more.  This time a 30 nm run to Concarneau.

Another excellent sail, mostly in sunshine.  There were flat seas and enough wind to have the boat near top speed until just before the end.  If only all sailing trips were like this.

I arrived ahead of schedule, and had arranged my own private marinero to take my lines on arrival.  Or more simply, during the 5 hours I'd taken to sail to Concarneau, John had driven there in an hour.  But it did make it much easier parking having someone there to help, especially since the slot was only barely big enough.  Perhaps a cigarette paper width either side.....

Concarneau has a very attractive, albeit small, old town which hosts a number eating houses, one of which we patronised.  The surroundings and ambience were great, but the food not of a particularly good standard. But this is just a quick stop, as I'll be continuing westwards and homewards and John will continue has land based adventure.
