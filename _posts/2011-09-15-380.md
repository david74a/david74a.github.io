# Cherbourg to Portsmouth

*Portsmouth* ![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img_1336-sml_scale.jpg)

It is with a tinge of sadness I compose this final entry, balanced at satisfaction at having completed the trip, and happiness at being home once more.  But enough sentimentality, on with the story.

The gales kept me in Cherbourg for a further 5 nights.  I agonised about a Wednesday crossing. The forecast was West to South West winds up to F6 and sea state of moderate to rough, so certainly it would be possible to cross, but I didn't relish the thought of being knocked around in rough seas for 12 hours when just one more day promised an easier crossing.

So Thursday became my last day.  I set off about 07.30 French time, with the promise of light but favourable winds.  For most of my trips the forecast has underestimated the wind, but not the met office this time.  No wind arrived, so it became a straightforward motor back.

About 15 nm from Cherbourg I saw a naval type vessel heading out, and wondered what they up to.

I didn't have to wonder for too long, as it was me that was their target, and they were the Douanes - French customs.  They circled, and indicated they wanted to talk on VHF.  They wanted to know where I'd come from, including the last 3 ports and where I was going.  On receiving these vital pieces of information, guaranteed to help with the war against terror, they bade me a good day and went on their way back to Cherbourg.  I'm sure French taxpayers will be reassured to know their money is being so well spent.

Visibility in the tripwas excellent.  I could see as far as the sun.  That's mainly excellent news, but it did mean I saw lots of ships as I crossed the shipping lanes, and saw the Isle of Wight from about 25 nm away.  It seemed to take forever to get there.

So finally I arrive back at Gosport in Portsmouth Harbour after:

### 2,516.2 nm 50 ports 114 days (3.8 months)

I wasn't expecting all the technical problems I had at the start, and was relieved I was able to get them fixed with minimal impact on the trip, just an unfortunate impact on my bank account.  Biscay was kind this year, with an ok trip south and a surprisingly easy trip north.

Looking back, I think with fondness of the people I'd met, and the friendliness, helpfulness and efficiency of the Spanish and Portuguse. British and French marinas could learn a lot from them.  It was interesting to experience the camaraderie of the British once away from the more familiar waters of the UK and France.  It didn't seem to matter what type or age or condition of boat or crew, there was spirit of being in it together, and helping each other whenever possible.  Sadly the nearer home, the weaker this camaraderie was.

I loved the Spanish Rias, and I really enjoyed my taste of hot climate on my own boat in southern Portugal.  Vianno do Castelo and Cascais were my Portuguese favourites.   I hated the crowds of the 1st few weeks in August in South Brittany which made seemingly attractive places almost intolerable.

I think on balance, I and the boat held up pretty well for this, for me, unforgettable trip, and one I'm very glad I made after dreaming of it for so many years.

Finally, thanks to you for reading, and I hope you enjoyed sharing some of my experiences.

I wonder what's next.................................
