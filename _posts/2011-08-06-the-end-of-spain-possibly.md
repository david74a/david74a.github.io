# Ribadeo to Gijon

Tuesday morning 2 August came and the boat was fortunately afloat, so I got underway about 08.30 for the 50 nm trip to Gijon.

The trip felt like slipping back into the old days.  There was no wind for the 1st 3 hrs, but then it became a following wind.  The wind varied from light to moderate to strong and back again.  But no big seas, and the fact it was a following wind made it all easy going.

I arrived at Gijon, something of a major holiday resort for the Spanish, but just missed 'the office'.  The price for that being a temporary berth and no marina internet access until the morning.  Still, after 4 consecutive days of sailing, a few days off in Gijon meant that didn't really matter.

The next day I moved to my allocated berth, and found myself with new neighbours who put my petty little trips to shame.  They were an American couple Ginger and Dick from New York, who are on their way to northern Europe after a few years in the Med.  They kindly invited me to join them the next day on a road trip to some ancient caves near Santander, complete with paintings to complete the cave decor.

We duly did the road trip, and the paintings were some of the oldest ever known.  I don't think Leonardo d'Vinci need worry about the competition.  Somehow the enigmatic smile of a Bison doesn't stand up to the Mona Lisa, but it was fascinating to see these images that ranged from 20-40,000 years ago.   That's before my time btw.  Access is very strictly controlled to ensure the paintings remain intact.

Our return took us through the Picos mountain range with really dramatic and beautiful gorges, and made such a change to the weeks, actually months now, of seascapes.

Today (Saturday 6 August) there was some drama in the marina as something of a super squall came through for about an hour. With winds reported up to 55 knts, that's Severe Gale force 9, bordering on Storm force 10.  It had skippers fussing around and adding extra lines, me included.  Then part way through this howling period, a race that had been running from Gijon returned, with boats and crew looking somewhat battered, many boats with tattered sails, adding to the drama by trying to berth in the extreme conditions.

I'm now waiting for a reasonable weather window to cross to somewhere in France.
