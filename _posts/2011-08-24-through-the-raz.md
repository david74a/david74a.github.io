# St Evette to Morgat

*Morgat* ![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/morgat03-sml_scale.jpg)

Wednesday morning and the trip westwards and homewards continues.

Today is Raz de Sein day.  It's the corner of Brittany, near Brest, and is notorious for being rough.  There is a small window of about 30 mins once every 6 hours when the tide is slack and it's considered safe to pass through.  My window was around 12.30, and one of the big advantages of St Evette is that it's about 10 nm from the Raz, and so it's reasonably easy to get the timing right.

I set off on time, and conditions were excellent.  In fact, too excellent.  Whilst I normally enjoy White Angel sailing swiftly, today was not the one I wanted it to go like the proverbial 'Bat of Hell'. But the boat had other ideas, and managed to get me to the Raz a little early.  Fortunately it was a neap tide, and the wind was not fighting the tide, so it wasn't too bad, and in what seemed like a blink of the eye, I was through and wondered what all the fuss was about.  Of course, had I mistimed it badly, I'd have known what the fuss is about, so no complaints.

I continued my excellent 30 nm sail to Morgat.  A small and pretty tourist town, with a small marina.   There was no shortage of room at the marina, and at last, sensible prices.  It was a mere €18.80 for the night including electricity.  Perhaps I should stay a week.
