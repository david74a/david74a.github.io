Portugal (Viano do Castelo) to Spain (Cangas)

Time to leave Portugal.

I escaped the pontoon, watched carefully by the lady from Falmouth on the next boat, who congratulated me on getting the boat out. It was difficult not to think how much easier it would have been with just one other person to help with the lines.  Even a lady.

The winds were as forecast, quite strong, and were the prevailing winds. That meant having to tack, and having a steady foul current.  The seas were very lumpy to ensure maximum discomfort.  It took about 9.5 hard hours to get to my destination, about 2 hours longer than on the way south, when I'd been travelling more slowly.  Conditions were such that it wasn't possible to make food, and even a tea or coffee seemed too hard for the first 7 hours.  As you will have deduced, despite the sunshine, this was not my favourite trip.

Nevertheless, 9.5 hours later, I was back in Spain.  Back in the Ria de Vigo, and anchored off a large village/small town called Cangas.   There was just one other boat at anchor, an American flagged Halberg Rassey, but seeing another boat increases my confidence that the anchorage will be ok.  There's a marina there too, but the plan was to anchor for the night and go in to the marina for the next day.  A penny saving excercise - not realising then quite how many pennies I was going to need to save as you'll read in the next installment.
