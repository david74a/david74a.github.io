# Porto Novo to Muros

*Muros ![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/muros03-sml_scale.jpg)*

Come Sunday morning, I got up a bit later than intended, and was not that rested having been rolled around all night at anchor.  It seems you can never tell what the night will be like until the night has been and gone.

So at just before 11.00, a civilised time, it was up anchor and away. The forecast winds were a N-NW F4, so as ever, not ideal, but to be expected.  The swell was forecast to be about 3m so that didn't suggest the most comfortable of trips either.

Reality was winds up to F6, and lumpy seas with a big swell.  It made the trip hard going especially at first when the tack was into the waves.  The latter 3rd was easier thanks to not smashing into waves and a helpful wind shift that brought the wind to about 40-50 degrees apparent, an excellent point of sail for White Angel, which responded by speeding up to about 7.5 knots and powering through the water as opposed to the earlier bouncing on the waves.  At least the sun shone, and that always helps make the world a happier place.

After an 8 hr trip, I arrived at my target destination of Muros, in the Ria de Muros.  There's no marina here, so anchoring is the only option, and several boats, perhaps 8, already had.  This was unusual as I'd got quite used to sailing and not seeing other boats, and anchoring either by myself, or with just another boat.  There was an event going on and the area I'd intended to anchor had been cordoned off for a rowing race.

I decided I couldn't cope with the crowds, and moved to an adjacent beach where life was more normal, and anchored with just one other boat. This anchorage proved to be superb, with little more boat movement than had I been in a marina.  The photo is from the boat at anchor.  It was also an excellent spot to view the firework display later that night which was lengthy and excellent.  Well above the standard of the others I'd seen in Spain and Portugal.
