# Corme to A Coruna

Monday was a longer trip, about 50 nm to A Coruna on the NW tip of Spain.

Whilst the winds offered few problems apart from the lack of them, that also meant the famous NW Spain fog was also present, at least for 2/3 of the trip.  Thankfully there are fewer lobster pots in this area, and shipping doesn't come in as close as I was.  The result, a smooth, albeit tiring trip, thanks to staring at the radar.

A Coruna is a major city and is a popular stopping off and arrival point for those crossing Biscay.  The 1st time I came here 10 years ago, it was common practice to anchor behind the huge breakwater at the head of the Ria, or squeeze into a small marina with no finger pontoons, tying up bows or stern to a long pontoon.  Usually squeezing into gaps that were almost big enough!

Today though there is a new and enormous marina, which has all facilities, and heavily underused.  The marina run a golf cart service to take people to the outer pontoons, such is the size of the place. However, more than ½ doesn't seem to be used, and many of the outer pontoons have not had the bird droppings cleaned off.  But the plus is plenty of room in a safe and all weather marina.

The latest bit of kit to cause a problem has been the fridge that seemed to have developed the characteristic of working when it thought it wanted the exercise, as opposed to when I wanted the fridge cooled down.

Coruna was a perfect place to get it fixed, and thanks to some advice front the Frigoboat agents in the UK (Penguin Engineering) who were very friendly and helpful, I got in touch through the marina with the Spanish agents, and then the local agent who turned up and topped up the fridge gas for the bargain price of €46.  So far, it now seems fine. Cold beers and G&T with ice and lemon are back on the menu.

Coruna has been mostly sunny, and a great place to sit out some strong winds that have been passing through, but tomorrow, Saturday, I hope to continue, and at long last turn the corner and eventually start to head east.  The winds have cottoned on to this ambition, and are now tending to be NE-E.  The joys of sailing.
