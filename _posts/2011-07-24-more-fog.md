# Camerinas to Corme

*Corme* ![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img_1121_scale.jpg)

After the few days in the sun at Camerinas, the winds eased, and allowed me to get a few more miles north under the keel.  Clearly I was not the only person that had worked out Sunday was a good time to move on, as when I got up, the marina was almost empty of the visitor boats.  It seemed quite strange seeing the transformation.

But as ever, the lighter winds allowed the mist and fog to gather, so whilst I tried sailing for 20 mins, I ended up motoring to Corme just about 20 nm up the coast, and anchoring there for the night.  On arrival there was only one other boat there, co-incidently the one that I was next to in Camerinas that had left earlier than I.
