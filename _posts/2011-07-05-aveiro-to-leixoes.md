# Aveiro to Leixoes

*Leixoes* ![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/leixoes-03_scale.jpg)

Tuesday 5th July.  I need to write the date as its all too easy to lose track of what day it is.  Up bright and early, well early anyway, to catch the tide down the river and back into the cruel Atlantic.

Fortunately it was not so very cruel, and I had an easy trip, but had to motor sail all the way, with seemingly no escape from the south going current.  At least there seemed to be relatively few lobster points on this stretch, and all I really needed to do was stretch out and sunbathe.

After logging another 36 nm or so, I arrived at Leixoes and tied up without drama.  Much, I suspect, to the disappointment of my Dutch neighbours who sat steadfastly glued to their cockpit seats, eyes locked firmly onto me berthing an 11.4m boat single handed.

I had bad memories of Leixoes from 5 yrs ago, when it seemed very drab, and it rained a lot.   But I decided to stay an extra day, just to have a bit of a rest.   This time however, the sun shone, and cast quite literally a new light on the place.   It is very industrial, but nonetheless has a much greater number of restaurants in quaint streets behind the marina than I'd ever imagined.  It even has a beach next to the marina to which I sampled a very pleasant beer in the sun.

At one point, whilst fiddling about in the cockpit, I heard for the 2nd time on this trip, the dulcet tones of "Rule Britania".  It was another P&O cruise ship leaving.  The other was in Vigo.  I guess it's a custom for them.
