# Ile de Ré to Ile d'Yeu

*Anchored at Ile d'Yeu ![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img_1198-sml_scale.jpg)*

I've decided I'm a trend setter.

When I anchored at Ile de Ré, I was the only boat in what felt a pretty big expanse of water.  For those that know Osbourne Bay off the Isle of Wight, this location made Osbourne Bay seem a sheltered enclave. Anyway, when I looked out about an hour later to see if I was still roughly in the right place, I discovered I was no longer alone.  Three other yachts had joined me, fortunately a comfortable distance away. Finding enough space was not a problem.

Sunday dawned with a grey and miserable day, and rain to match.  I suppose I'd taken for granted the lack of rain I've experienced over the last couple of months.  Still, on the plus side, the wind was blowing from a kindly direction so off I set for the 50 nm trip to Ile d'Yeu.

The rain lasted about ½ the trip, and the wind about 2/3 of the trip, and there was sun at the end.  Despite the rain, it wasn't too bad a trip and I made a useful 50 nm in the homeward direction.  I arrived at my target bay to the south of the Ile, to see another 2 boats there, both rolling merrily from side to side.  I decided to try the next bay, but that was much the same, so I returned to the 1st and crept inside of the yellow marker buoys marking out the empty swimming area in the hope of dodging some of the swell.

It was pretty rolly at 1st, but fortunately settled down for a reasonable night.
