# Cedeira to Viveiro

*Underway* ![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img_1150-sml_scale.jpg)

Sunday came around after a peaceful night, and after a leisurely breakfast, I set off once more.  The wind was initially around 1 gusting 2.  That's knots not Beaufort!  So initially it was a pleasant motor on flat seas taking in the spectacular views of mountains meeting the sea. The motoring was useful as it topped up the charge in the batteries.

After a couple of hours the wind picked up a little.  The wrong direction of course, so tacking was again the order of the day.  The big difference today was that with the relatively light winds (peaked at about 16 knots), no perceptible swell, and flat seas, it was it was an easy and comfortable sail.  It was even steady enough to prepare my hamburguesa and salad sandwich for lunch.

But of course all sails have their trials and tribulations, and this was no exception.  I found it very difficult to get a comfortable spot in the sun when on the port tack (that means the wind coming from the left), and I had to clean up crumbs I dropped from my lunch sandwich. Sailing can be very hard sometimes.

7 hours and 40 nm after setting off, I anchored in another great spot in the Ria de Viveiro, off a pretty and clearly popular beach.  It's not as settled as the previous anchorage, but hopefully it will do.
