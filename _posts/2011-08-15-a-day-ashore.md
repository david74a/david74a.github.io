# Ile d'Yeu

*Port Joinville - Ile d'Yeu ![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img_1204-sml_scale.jpg)*

Another sunny day, so after the last 2 nights at anchor, time for civilisation. That means wi-fi, electricity and the ability to walk ashore.

I made the massive 7 nm voyage from my anchorage to Port Joinville, the main port on the on the island.  The pilot book advised a popular and attractive town with an excellent but very busy marina, and recommended booking in advance.  Not very encouraging given I hadn't done so.

But luck was on my side.  I had hoped that by anchoring the previous night, I'd be able to go into the marina in the morning when at least some people would be leaving.  It worked, and I got a finger pontoon in a good spot, and avoided the evening rush, crush and rafting.  The charge felt high at €36, and the wi-fi was extra.  In Spain and Portugal it was normally included.  Burt I was in, and had time to shop and sightsee.

I walked past the main industry on the island of bike hire, the kilometre or so to the nearest supermarché,  which is open 09.00 - 19.00 Monday to Saturday.  Great.  So why was it shut?  Undeterred, I walked to the bigger supermarché at the other end of town, 3 km or so away. Shut again!  I wondered if in fact it was Sunday, and my watch was wrong.  I have been struggling to know what day of the week it is.  But I eventually concluded I'd arrived at yet another destination to celebrate a bank holiday.

I consoled myself with a train trip around the island.  But we're not talking TGV here, rather a car dressed up to look like an engine, towing about 4 carts behind it.  A tourist train.  Still, as the island is tiny, smaller than Alderney I'd say, it did a comprehensive tour that was probably faster than walking speed, but I wouldn't bet on it.  I did get to see some of the island's very attractive small beaches and lush greenery though.

The evening sported a live band and ended with a great firework display.

Despite the teeming hoards, this really is a good place to visit.
