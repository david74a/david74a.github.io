# La Rochelle to Isle de Ré

*La Rochelle* ![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img_1190-sml_scale.jpg)

La Rochelle seems an attractive and interesting place.  That seems to be a view I shared with Paris, all of the inhabitants of which, seemingly in La Rochelle this week!  I haven't really encountered crowds of people over the last couple of months, including the most touristy bits, so the teeming masses came as something of an uncomfotable shock.

But the town is old, interesting architecture, bigger than I expected, and bustling is an understatement.  There were many street performers throughout the day and late into the evening.  Clearly this was a place worth staying 3 nights.  Co-incidently, the marina grants 1 night free if you pay for 2.

The marina was at Minimes, about 40 mins walk to the old harbour.  I would have preferred to have gone to the old harbour, but hadn't wanted to do the trip up the relatively narrow channel in the dark.  That turned out to be a wise choice, as White Angel is too deep for the old harbour, but if I'd arrived at high water in the day, lock gates would have been opened to allow access to an adjacent deeper water basin.

But Minimes did benefit from a water bus service that my former colleagues at the Department of Energy and Climate Change would have been proud of.  A solar powered water bus, capable of carrying over 60 people.  The service ran from 08.00 to 23.30 - but I couldn't help wonder how it got the sun at night.......

I spent one very pleasant evening having dinner with my new American friends that I'd met in Gijon and been cave watching with.  We all also had a genial stroll around the street entertainers before a quayside nightcap.  I then went to get the water bus back at about 11.40 pm. This was when I realised the last one was 11.30.  Not to worry, I'd had sufficient spirits to not notice the time as I strolled the 40 mins back on a balmy summer evening.

I left La Rochelle on a sunny Saturday afternoon, entering an exit channel that would make Portsmouth Harbour entrance on an August bank holiday seem tranquil.  Given my sighting of other boats for the last few months didn't generally exceed the digits of 1 hand, this was all rather shocking.  Still, I negotiated ferries, dinghies and other boats, and got safely out.

I then sailed under the huge bridge that joins Isle de Ré to mainland France and anchored for the night in a very open bay that proved to be ok for the night near St Martin on the Isle de Ré.
