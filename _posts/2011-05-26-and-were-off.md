# Gosport to Portland

*Hopefully not firing at me....*[![portland 01]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/portland-01.jpg)](http://digicasts.org/whiteangel/2012/12/and-were-off/portland-01/)

At long last we're off. We being White Angel and I for now.

The forecast said good things for Weds, bad things Thurs, and better on Friday. I decided to make the best of the good day, and set the alarm for 06.30 for an early start, aiming for Studland Bay. But I awoke with the sun around 05.00, in time to see Stuart and Betty setting off for Cherbourg at 05.30. I managed to get underway at 06.00 on a beautiful bright morning of sunshine and no wind.

After motoring to just past Cowes, the wind started as promised, and coming from the S-SE made an easy sail with no engine. By 09.30 I was out of the Solent and heading across Poole Bay, now with 2 reefs, but not too rough and making excellent progress, so I decided to head for Portland.

Portland is an old harbour but has a new marina and also the option to anchor.Â  It looks reasonably sheltered in winds from the South through West to North. Strong to gale force SW-W winds and rough seas were forecast for Thurs, so this seemed a good spot to wait. I'd also never been there before.

The route to Portland passes by (or through if you get it wrong) the Lulworth firing range, needing a bit of a detour out to sea. I did indeed here one loud shot too. I also had a slightly nervous 30 mins or so, when I realised that I was between a warship and the shore, but more significantly between it and the designated firing zone. I also knew I was very close to the edge of the firing zone, as I didn't want to go further offshore than necessary.

The warship manoeuvred around, and at one point was pointing straight at me, but we danced about and missed each other, and I got into Portland about 16.00. I'd always thought Portland and neighbouring Weymouth too far for a day sail, so was delighted to have done it, and with relative ease.

Pursuing economy, I anchored in the very large harbour, with empty resident boats on moorings for company. Next to wait out the gale.

Well the gale came, in fact a Force 7, so a near gale, though the distinction offered little consolation as I was woken around 03.00 with the wind whistling through the rigging, the boat swinging around, and bouncing a little in the waves generated even inside the harbour. Checking an anchor in the pitch black with the wind trying to blow you off the deck is not one of my favourite activities.

Thursday has continued with strong winds, but they're gently easing a bit as I type. The new wind generator has been excellent, generating more power than I needed, at times over 10 amps. So at least I've had the luxury of the heating on, the fridge on for the essential cold beer and ice for G&T, with ability to watch films on my laptop if I fancy. In fact I opted to catch up on episodes of Fringe.

Here's hoping tomorrow brings more moderate winds for getting around Portland Bill as forecast. Sadly they look not to be the ideal direction, so if I set off, I can expect a bit of a long slog.
