# Vigo to Combarro

Thursday 14 July and I'm getting an itchy keel, so time to press on northwards.

It was a lovely day, sunshine, warm but not too hot, and a light to moderate wind in perfect visibility, so off I go.  I tacked gently down the Ria de Vigo, where the wind increased for a short time in the open see giving more of a fun sail. Still easy going as there was little swell, and flattish seas.  Then turning into the Ria de Pontevedra, to have a relaxed easy sail to the head of the Ria, anchoring off the marina at Combarro.

It was a 25 nm trip.  It would have been a great introduction to sailing as it was perfection and trouble free all the way.  If only all trips could be like that.  The other good news is that the engine is now starting 1st time, and the new anchor windless control worked faultlessly.

The next day, the engine again started with ease, and I went into the marina and succeeded in one of my worst ever parks.  The wind had piped up and was blowing the boat off the target pontoon, almost blowing it onto the next boat in fact.  But no damage was done so only my pride was injured.

Combarro is on the local tourist trail, and whilst most it is relatively modern, there is a very old 'historic' village with Celtic origins, and small detached houses made out of granite and very narrow streets - not wide enough for a cart, let alone car.  There were also little slipways which in days gone by would have been used to launch canoe sized fishing boats.  It was a little touristy, but interesting nonetheless.

That evening I risked my first solo tapas, which was good, and later socialised with another British couple that had arrived that day.  They were going south, and I north, so we swapped stories about where was good and where was bad.
