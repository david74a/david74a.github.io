# Viana do Castelo to Povoa de Varzim

*Is this the Costa del Sol, Costa Brava maybe?* [![povoa 01]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/povoa-01.jpg)](http://digicasts.org/whiteangel/2012/12/creeping-south/povoa-01/)

No. These are not hotels, nor are there bars and restaurants on the front.  They are simply housing, and it's Porvao de Varzim, a 25 nm trip from Viano do Castelo.

Porvao de Varzim attained some unfortunate notoriety earlier this year when a British yacht with 3 young men on board got swept onto rocks whilst trying to enter the port when there was a large swell.  They lost not just the boat, but their lives.  It was hard to ignore that recollection as I came in.

The remains of their boat is still here, now covered as it's not a memory the locals want to preserve.  Looking at the small covered pile earlier, it was scarcely believable that it was once a yacht.

On a brighter note, the weather has improved, and after checking carefully that there were no locals to scare within sight, my bathing costume had its 1st airing as I motored along in bright warm sunshine.  I was only able to sail for about an hour, and the engine did the rest of the 5 hr trip.  The waters are getting much busier now - I saw 2 other boats on this journey.

The marina is only €15.50 per night including showers, electricity and wi-fi. Plymouth by comparison was £40.   It seems a good spot to take a few days off.
