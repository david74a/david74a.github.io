# Cangas to Vigo

*Vigo* ![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/imag0187_scale.jpg)

Monday 11 July started early for me, as I discovered that either the ferry service or fishing boats operating from Cangas would create a wake causing the boat to roll quite violently from side to side in what was otherwise a peaceful anchorage off a pretty beach, and it seems they start early!

To put things into perspective, when the boat was rolling from side to side, it was not only enough to allow the chopping board to slide back and fore in the sink, but it actually rocked the knife and fork off a plate waiting to be washed up!  Perhaps it was nature's way of telling me not to leave the washing up.

But up I got, got the anchor up, but only just, as the control for the electric windless decided it was happy enough letting the anchor down, but less enthusiastic about pulling it up again.  I sympathised with the sentiment, but was not impressed with the implications - me having to haul up the anchor if it wouldn't work.

I chugged into Cangas marina, which was much smaller than I'd expected, and eventually had to come to terms with the fact that there was 'no room at the inn'.  There was nothing for it, but to cross to Vigo, where I'd intended to visit to fuel up and also try and get a Spanish sim card for 3g access.

Vigo was only a couple of miles across the Ria, and fortunately they had space.  Now Vigo is the marina where you have to reverse in, tie lines to the back of the boat and tie the bow to a line secured in the sea bed in front of the boat.  This latter line has a 'lazy line' attached which is tied on the shore.  So when berthing you need the three lines more or less at once.  Fortunately, unlike the previous time, parking this time went well with no drama.  I'd love to say it was down to my expertise, but in truth was really due to the lack of wind making it easy.

Once tied up I realised I could smell a stowaway.  Somehow there was ½ of a rotting fish, and bits of fish guts at the back of the boat.  It was disgusting, and given I've never let anyone fish off the boat because of the mess; it must have been nature's revenge.  It's anyone's guess as to how they got there.  Mine is it fell from seagulls following one of those fishing boats into Cangas that spill knives and forks.

Since leaving Portsmouth, the boat has been dogged with an engine starting problem.  In the scale of the other problems though, it didn't seem as big an issue as the others, given the engine did eventually start.  The symptoms were that the engine would fire 1st time, as it always has, but then die.  It might take 2 or 3 time then to start, after which it ran normally.  This suggested a leak in the fuel line, allowing air to creep in.  Before this trip, I'd had a new fuel pre-filter added, this seemed those most likely cause as it was the only change.   I knew how to bypass this filter was had been reluctant to do so, as I couldn't see how to avoid doing so without spilling smelly diesel into the bilge.

By the time I got to Vigo, the engine was due a minor service.  So I opted to call in the professionals.  The local Volvo agent.  They could do the service and bypass the filter.  The good news is that €190 later, the engines oil and filters have been refreshed, and the bypass operation a success.  The engine has started faultless over the next few days.  The bad news is that I had to spend an hour or so cleaning out spilt diesel from the bilge!  The engineer clearly didn't share my qualms about split diesel.

The other big expense was that the control for the anchor windless was discontinued about 6 years ago.  The fix was a new control, which needed a new plug, and different wiring to the windless control system.  Or in simple English, another €180.  Hence my need to save some penies.

THe Spanish sim card turned out to be not available.  All I could do would be to by a USB dongle and card, which for a month and 1 gb of data was €65.  Not great value, so I left it.

I spent a few days at Vigo, recharging not just the boat's batteries, but my own.  Whilst there, I took the ferry back to Cangas, which turned out to be a nice place to visit, and the benefit of some excellent supermarkets.  Something I'd failed to find locally in Vigo.  So I stocked up a bit.  The Halberg Rassey Americans were still there, so not so bothered by the rolling I guess.
