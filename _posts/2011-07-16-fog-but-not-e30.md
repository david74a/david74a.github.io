# Combarro to Porto Novo

*Porto Novo* ![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/porto-novo-sml_scale.jpg)

The marina at Combarro was good, but seemed expensive at €30 per night, especially after the Portuguese ones that were as little as €15.50, so after my 1 night and a day of making the most of shore power and free wi-fi, off I set.

I had intended to get up early and make a significant trip to another Ria. But in fact I slept a bit late and the weather was a bit grim. Uncharacteristically very grey, poor visibility and light winds.  So I decided instead to make the easy and relatively short sail down to a bay between Porto Novo and Sanxenxo.  This allowed a leisurely breakfast and a late start.

The sail was easy, not quick, and uneventful, though not pleasant as the poor visibility deteriorated into thick fog.  Even the dolphins didn't like the weather.  I saw a few, and they were lethargically appearing on the water before diving below.  They seemed to be in slow motion. Nevertheless I completed the 10 nm trip and safely anchored off the beach.

There is a line of buoys marking off the beach to stop boats going in too far, and at one point I thought I was seeing things when a saw something black bobbing up and down near these buoys, and another behind, and another and another.  It turned out to be people swimming.  I guess there must be some sort of sporting event, as there was a small crowd on the beach, and the swimmers swam the length of the bay, ran back down the beach, then across the bay again.  They must be really fit!
