# Morgat to the Rade de Brest

*Anchored near Roscanvel* ![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img_1286-sml_scale.jpg)

I think need a rest soon, but not today.  My fourth consecutive day of sailing takes me somewhere even better value than Morgat.

I set off in what seemed like no wind in the marina that quickly turned into over 20 knots on the nose initially.  But after 4 nm miles and clearing the Morgat bay, I turned significantly to the right, and had a much easier time sailing towards Brest, and into the Rade de Brest.  A large but sheltered stretch of water.

The trip was another 22 nm under the keel, and I anchored near Roscanvel just before the weather had a dramatic change to a torrential, but short lived downpour.
