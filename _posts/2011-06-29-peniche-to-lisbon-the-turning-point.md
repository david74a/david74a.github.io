I've been a bit negligent with my blogging so time to catch up a bit.

After a day off at Peniche, when I think some sort of local marathon was being run, and there was arguably, correction, there was definitely, the worst firework display I've ever see, I set off southwards once more.  The firework display was about 4 rockets that made a bang!

Monday 26 June at about 08.30 I left Peniche and logged about 42 nm doing  a 50 nm trip south to Caiscas, thanks to favourable Atlantic current going ever southwards.  But it was a  tedious trip despite the glorious sunny weather.  The problem was that the wind every now and then would be enough to sail nicely, but only for 10 mins before dying again.  This meant constantly setting and unsetting sails.  Sadly, lobster pots were also back out, so it was a far from relaxing trip.  I had company though, as the Hunter yacht that had anchored in my lagoon at Aveiro, was making the same trip, them having been at anchor outside Peniche.

Nevertheless, I eventually arrived in the money.  Up until now, it has been clear that Portugal is not the most affluent of countries, but when I arrived at Caiscas (pronounced appropriately 'cash-cash'), the standard of the buildings was more high tech, and the marina home to visiting super or even mega yachts.  Caiscas is also an upmarket holiday resort, once frequented by Portuguese royalty (I'm told).

The marina is reported to be expensive, and would have been an estimated €40+ per night.  So I anchored outside.  This turned out to be a bad move.  The winds that had been skittish all night, blew up to a solid 20-22 knots for anchoring, and blowing the boat about at anchor. Fortunately the wind died away as the sun went to bed, but there was a rogue swell that entered the bay, causing the boat to rock quite a bit, and this made for a disturbed night.

Tuesday saw me make the short hop of about 5 nm to Oeiris, within the limits of the river for Lisbon.  But first I popped into Caiscas to get some more camping gas, and potentially top up the diesel, as my guide (wrongly) said there was no gas at Oeiris. The gas was ok, and there was a diesel pontoon with 3 pumps suitable for 3 yachts.  OR - 1 bloody great big mega yacht occupying the whole thing, and draining the tanks dry I imagine.  So no diesel.

Oeiris is to be a stopping point for a day or so, and more significantly, my turning point before starting the struggle northwards. The marina is new, and not on my electronic charts.  But somehow I managed to find it.  It's not big, but has all facilities, €10 cheaper than Caiscas, and extremely friendly and helpful staff, most of whom thankfully speak English.

I'd been allocated a berth over the radio, which was the 1st time I'd called a marina in Spain or Portugal, dreading the potential language problems - but this time it was ok.  On entering the marina and looking for the berth, someone called out my name.   It took a while for me to realise it was someone calling me, as I was not expecting anyone to know me here.  But it turned out to be a couple off a Feeling 44 that I'd chatted to a few stops back at Nazaré, who helpfully helped me park.  But 2 British boats in the same marina was too much so they left within 30 mins of my arrival for another marina upstream where they were leaving their boat for the July and August period.  Or silly season as they said.  It really does seem to be a small cruising world.

This area increasingly feels like a med style holiday, with great weather and great beaches, and things being increasingly geared to tourism.  For instance, I passed Estoril, I name a recognised as a package holiday resort.

This has been a stopover to tidy things up a bit on the boat, re-provision, and do the tourist thing at Lisbon.  The winds have also been quite strong and not suitable to move anyway.  They do sell diesel here, but so far I haven't seen anyone buy any, which makes me a bit reluctant in case it's past its best in this days of increasing use of bio diesel.

Tomorrow (Thursday 30 June), I hope to leave.  It will be a long slog back to Peniche, or if the winds are still too strong, I may just get a bit nearer by going to Caiscas.
