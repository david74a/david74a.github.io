# Ile de Noirmoutier to Ile Dumet

*At Anchor Ile Dumet* ![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img_1224-sml_scale.jpg)

An early morning start was needed to escape my 'pool' and embark on a 31 nm trip to Ile Dumet.

I had decided to visit Piriac sur Mer which got a good write up in the pilot guide, but it had a tricky entrance needing HW.  I realised I would arrive too early and need to anchor to wait, and that I would get in about 20.00 which would be a little late to take in the town.  When I also discovered the marina may be even more expensive than the last one, I decided to find an anchorage for the night, and aim to go in for the morning.

Ile Dumet won.  But try to find it on Google if you can.  It's more of a rock with a bit of sand than an island, but given the settled weather I hoped it would do, and is only about 5-6 nm from Piriac.

I sailed slowly for about ½ of the trip and motored the rest when the wind died.

This must the most exposed anchorage yet, and that really is saying something.
