# Brixham to Plymouth

*Not a pretty sight...*

Brixham is a pretty place, but with strong winds galore, my nerves got stretched a few times with the comings and goings of those large heavy wooden boats.

With big thanks to Westaway sails and Adrian of Eurospars for being fantastically responsive, repairs have been arranged.

Someone from Westaways came to the boat in Brixham on Saturday morning (on his day off) to help take the main sail off, and take it away to Plymouth for repair. Eurospars thought they had the needed part in stock, and scheduled a visit for Tuesday morning, the first possible time after the bank holiday.

Monday came, and thankfully the winds had eased, so off I set under engine for Plymouth at an almost reasonable 07.50. It was a cold wet morning with mist/fog, so far from pleasant. But the 6 hr trip was uneventful (phew!), and eventually the mist cleared, and things dried up.

I'm now waiting in Sutton Harbour marina in Plymouth with some evening sunshine and a beer for repairs tomorrow.
