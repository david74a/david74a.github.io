# Vigo to Viana do Castelo

[![port - viana do castelo]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/port-viana-do-castelo.jpg)](http://digicasts.org/whiteangel/2012/12/portugal/port-viana-do-castelo/)Sunday was a pleasant sail to Bayona, even if it was tacking all the way to an anchorage just off the marina, joining about ½ a dozen other boats there.

Monday came, along with a change in the weather.  I awoke to rain, and a distinct lack of pleasant scenery thanks to the poor visibility.  It was so tempting to stay in bed.  In fact I did for a little while.  But my resolve was strengthened with the aid of a bacon sandwich, and the rain stopping, so up came the anchor and at a rather later than intended 09.45, I set off for another country.

The prevailing winds here are northerly, and not unlike the prevailing SW winds in the channel that magically reverse to NE when you want to return to the Solent from Cherbourg, the winds here became an unhelpful southerly.  Initially the seas were a bit bumpy and I had 1 reef in, but made relatively slow and uncomfortable progress tacking into the southerly wind.  The winds got lighter and the seas smoothed, leaving insufficient wind for the last 15 nm of what turned out to be a 47 nm trip.

It was a tiring trip thanks to the conditions, and also to the increase in lobster pots, even in depths of over 100m.  But no matter, I eventually turned into the Rio (river) Lima, and parked up at Viana do Castelo at about 17.45.  This allowed time for paperwork formalities, eating, and a shower, before exploring ashore, and doing something that seems so right here - having a well earned glass of port.
