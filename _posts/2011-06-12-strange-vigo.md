# Vigo

*My Neighbour* [![vigo cruise ship]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/vigo-cruise-ship.jpg)](http://digicasts.org/whiteangel/2012/12/strange-vigo/vigo-cruise-ship/)

Yesterday I was messing about on the boat, when I heard the dulcet tones of a welsh male voice choir singing 'We'll Keep a Welcome in the Hillsides', followed by a Irish Jig, Rule Brittania and Land of Hope and Glory.  It felt surreal to here such music in a Spanish marina.

It turns out the massive block of flats I saw that had appeared overnight was in fact the P&O Cruise Liner Venturer.  The music was them making something of an event of their departure.

In the bars here, it seems common practice to serve complementary nibbles with drinks.  The challenge is: do I go to a restaurant to eat, or live off bar nibbles which have included tortilla, chorizo, pepperoni and cheese with the consequential risk of psoriasis of the liver as I'm forced to consume ever increasing amounts of alcohol? Advice welcome.

I've resolved to agonise no more over this challenge, but leave Vigo today for the entrance to the Ria, and set off for Portugal tomorrow or Tuesday, depending on the weather.
