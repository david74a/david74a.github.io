# Portland to Brixham

05.00 - time to get up. Why do tides always seem to need me to get up so early?

Thankfully the winds had eased, so time to escape what felt like the barren seascape of Portland Harbour. Having said that, checking the inshore forecast showed my sailing area fringed with a very attractive red. For the uninitiated, that indicates strong winds, and in my case, as always it seems, strong winds in the wrong direction.

Nevertheless, up came the anchor, with what looked like ½ of the mud of the harbour with it. Still, eventually, I got underway.  As I was leaving the harbour I saw another yacht heading east towards Poole, and I thought how nice and so much more comfortable it would be to do that. But with crew waiting in Falmouth, it was west I had to go.

The seas off the Portland Bill headland are notoriously rough, but this was a headland I had to get round. There are two accepted ways. One is to go about 5 nm offshore to miss it, the other to time the trip for slack water, and then take the inshore passage if the wind is not a strong onshore wind, saving an hour or maybe more. Pilot books of old used to say that the passage needed to be close enough to the rocks to be able to throw a biscuit ashore.

With the Bill in the distance the winds decided to help and pipe up a bit, so time to reef the sails. I put in the 2nd reef in the main sail and heard what I can only describe as a sickening sound. It was that of material tearing. Sure enough, there were 2 vertical rips about 30-40 cm in length beneath the 2nd reef point. At least I could continue to sail, but would need plenty of wind with the reduced size main sail. But that didn't seem to be a problem.

The next excitement came as I approached the Bill and I could see the sea being lightened and made more interesting by lines of white. Rough sea ahead!  It was indeed a bit rough, and I took one solid green wave across the boat, but the worst of it was only for 30 mins or so, and then it was just bumpy as I continued across Lyme Bay towards Brixham in W-NW 5/6 winds.

As I crossed the Bay, whilst never calm and easy, it became easier, to the point that I could go below and make a cuppa and prepare my long overdue bacon sandwich. Whilst doing that I heard a loud bang. Now if you're ever on a boat and hear a bang, you never really know what it is. But what you can be sure of is that it is not good news. On this occasion, the line that furls away the front sail, or in strong winds reduces the sail size by keeping some of it furled away broke. This allowed the front sail to immediately open out fully making the boat over canvassed. What I didn't realise until later was that it also broke part of the furling gear.

I then had great fun crawling to the front of the boat as it bucked up and down in the bumpy sea to tie the broken line together as a temporary fix. White Angel is a pretty dry boat, but not at the front when the bow crashes through the waves, so I had a pretty thorough salt water wash.

The trip continued with no further excitement, but I think I'd had enough excitement! I arrived at Brixham to discover there was a heritage festival going on and the harbour was full of traditional wooden boats. Very pretty, but a bit scary when you're the only light and rather more fragile plastic boat in the middle of them.

The Harbour Master wasn't really very happy with me being there, and suggested I should move. But with the marina costing 3 times as much, I wasn't keen. Somehow I managed to talk myself into staying, and then got on with organising repairs as in effect I could no longer sail.
