# Muxia to Camerinas

*Camerinas* ![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/camerinas02---sml_scale.jpg)

This was a big trip day.  2 nm and 20 mins across the ria to Camerinas. A small but perfectly formed marina, with very friendly staff, and a pleasant clubhouse serving good and good value food.

Camerinas is a nice small town, but there's not a lot there. However it's location makes it a natural stop off point for those headed North or South, and clearly, I was no exception.

I parked, somewhat inelegantly, but with no damage, onto a pontoon which makes the fingers of a French pontoon look oversized!  For those less familiar with French pontoons, the pontoon finger was tiny, not quite reaching the centre cleat about ½ way along the boat.  But, once safely tied up, I could relax into the luxury of shore power and wi-fi.

For the next few days, the sun came out to play, but as did stronger winds from the north.  The marina filled up, and I was able to watch a number of other visitors park 'somewhat inelegantly'.  It really is quite a small marina, with little space to manoeuvre.

I decided a day off sailing was in order, so the next day took the bus to Santiago de Compostela, famous for its cathedral, and the many people that still make a pilgrimage there.  It was a 2 hr bus journey, leaving me about 3 hrs in the city before making sure I got the only bus back. It made a pleasant change to be away from the sea and not thinking about boat things for a little while.
