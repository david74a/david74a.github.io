# Aveiro and Sao Jactim

*Aveiro (Not Venice) ![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/_s_aveiro01_scale.jpg)*

A day off, so time to play with my toys.  Out came the petrol generator, which started 1st time and topped up the batteries and laptop nicely. Out came the dinghy and outboard, it was time explore ashore.

*The Lagoon* ![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/sbkw7qjj.jpg)

The lagoon in which I was the only yacht anchored is next to an army base treating me to various bugle performances throughout the day, and a village called Sao Jactim.  A village with 2 bars, a small shop and little else.

My pilot book recommends Aveiro, and says there is a ferry from the village, so I decide to try that.

There is indeed a ferry, which I foolishly assumed would take me to Aveiro.  I fact it deposited me and the other passengers on the other side of the river, on some desolate, windswept spot some estimated 15-20 miles from Aveiro.  No-one else seemed perturbed, so I figured something else must happen.  And after just a few minutes it did.  A bus came into view, sped past on the other side of the road, leaving a dust cloud in its wake, turning at a roundabout to come and collect us poor travellers and take us on the 25 min ride to the City of Aveiro.

Whilst recuperating after the days travel to foreign places back on board with a re-assuring G&T, another yacht also dared to use my anchorage.  I've seen a few other yachts on this trip, typically locals, French, Swedish even, but this one was not just British, it was also from Gosport.  Amazing.  A very nice couple on their way to the med.
