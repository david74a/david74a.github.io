Thankfully repairs are complete, but 10 yrs of sailing in all too often "challenging" weather had taken its toll on the furling gear, and I now have new furling gear at vast expense.

But all credit to Eurospars and Westaway sails who have been incredibly helpful and efficient in getting me back in operation in just one working day. Thanks guys.

So bye bye Sutton Harbour, Plymouth. I timed my departure more around using the free flow on the lock than the currents, but fortunately, the timing also meant I had a fair tide for the trip.

It was an uneventful trip for a change but no wind to speak of. I think I sailed for about 20 mins out of the 6 hr trip. But it was a gloriously blue and sunny day, with nicely chilled beer, so not so bad. It was just a case of dodging shipping hazards like the fishing boat oblivious to his surroundings. Of course he had the right of way so the rules of the road were on his side.

Now in Falmouth, it's Friday and the day before the start of the AZAB race. A single or short handed race to the **AZ**ores **A**nd **B**ack. It's almost tempting to stay to see the 80 odd yacht event plus well wishers off on their journey. But if I want to see a lot of yachts in the same place, there's always the Solent.

Marty joins me this afternoon so there will be 2 of us for the outward Biscay crossing. The forecast doesn't look too bad, so the plan is to set off around 6-7 pm towards Spain, crossing the shipping lanes near Oussent before turning towards √Å Coruna.

I wonder where we'll be in 4 or 5 days time.
