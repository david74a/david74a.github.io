Some good things and some bad things.

The good things, progress at last. The rigger confirmed that they could start the work on Monday (today), and could I bring the boat to Chichester Marina then.

So yesterday, I was up at the crack of dawn.  Anything earlier than 10 am  =  the crack of dawn for me.  But this time it was 0700 to get the east going tide to help me towards Chichester, and to catch the lock free flow into Chichester marina, not somewhere I've been before. Free flow is when a lock is open at both ends simultaneously, allowing free non-stop passage through.

The trip was uneventful, though with sunshine, and a moderate wind and flat seas, it would have made a great sailing trip, rather than the dull chug under engine.

Entry to the marina was interesting, as it had the narrowest lock I've ever used, and the water was rushing into the marina on the still rising tide when I arrived. It felt like I was being flushed in as the boat accelerated in the narrow gap. There was a nice big berth waiting for me, but with the wind blowing me directly off, not the easiest of parkings. Fortunately some people on the next boat took my lines, and I got the boat parked in one piece.

There was some less good news though.  My sails and sail covers have been off being laundered and serviced. They were returned to Gosport Marina Friday as planned, but when I collected them Saturday, no sail cover! This created the nightmare scenario of needing a new one, and a potential further delay to the trip.

Fortunately, the sailmaker owned up today to having forgotten to send it, and promised to have it in Gosport by the end of today.

The mast is now out. In true nautical fashion, the 30 min job took over 2hrs as the mast was not keen on leaving the boat, and eventually the sealant at the deck level had to be drilled out. The poor boat was moaning and groaning as pressure was applied to lift the mast, and I suspect similar noises were coming from me.

But it's out - roll on the new one.
