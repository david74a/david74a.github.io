# Oeris to Caiscas

![ddd]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img_1017-small_scale.jpg)

Thursday morning came with relatively favourable winds for setting off. i.e. not too strong, albeit in completely the wrong direction.  But on closer inspection, the forecast also indicated quite a big swell, a major consideration for the north Portugal coast, so I decided on a lay in and a short trip to Cascais.  Somehow, choosing a lay in has always seemed a good choice for me........

I made the short hop to Cascais and took the opportunity to refuel at about €6 per gallon, or €1.36 per litre.  Whilst there was only 1 petrol pump, there was more than one diesel pump.  I'll know this for next time.  But this time I stopped at the 1st diesel pump which also meant blocking the petrol pump, much to the chagrin of a motor boater who arrived shortly after I'd tied up.

People have to queue and or wait, its a fact of life.  Unfortunately for the poor motor boater, after fuelling, I popped into the marina office to check in, expecting this to take just a few minutes.  Sadly it took a lot longer than a few minutes as forms were filled in, boat papers examined and photocopied, and I was taken through the welcome procedure, including a complimentary bottle of wine, all interrupted at regular intervals by phone calls.

The waiting motor boater got fed up with waiting and called the marina to complain.  They were duly sympathetic and told him 'tough luck' and told me it was no problem.  It wasn't the one in the picture, but a small day boat.

The marina was expensive at €40, but did have wi-fi, and the whole area felt very upmarket.

Cascais feels very much a tourist resort, and that night I ate in the main tourist square (off to the right in the pic), against popular belief around avoiding tourist eating places, but I'm glad I did as the place had a buzz and atmosphere to it, complete with a selection of live music.

To eat I had 4 meats served with a hot stone.

The meal was unsuitable for a vegetarian to even share the table, or perhaps be enjoyed by anyone other than a committed meat eater.  Vegetarians or those sensitive about eating animals should stop reading  at this point and resume with the next posting.

The 4 meats were some cuts of beef (2) , pork and lamb, served on a plate, raw and dripping with blood. The idea is to cook the meat on the hot stone. BUT the stone was really only big enough for 1 piece, so it became a race to cook and eat before the stone got too cold. This was only tenable if the meat was lightly cooked, so blood oozed everywhere.

But I enjoyed it.    :)
