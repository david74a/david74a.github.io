# Leixoes to Aveido

*The welcoming breakwater [![aveido-01]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/aveido-01.jpg)](http://digicasts.org/whiteangel/2012/12/am-i-mad-to-be-here/aveido-01/)*

Sunday dawned after a good night's sleep as the wind had eased off overnight.  It dawned with a gentle breeze, blue sky and sunshine.  Time to explore new places.

I'd chosen Aveido as my next stop, though goodness knows why.   The pilot book says:

*   "Windswept channels and lagoons, inside a potentially dangerous entrance"* Apparently Aveido is one of the first ports to close in the event of high swell, and access is recommended to only be undertaken between 1 hour before high water and high water.  The guide goes on to claim the ebb time can run at up to 8 knots.  With a boat with a top speed of 7 knots, that would be something of a challenge.

Still, let the adventure continue.  The wind freshened, but was on the stern quarter so I had an easy and fast sail, arriving a bit earlier than ideal, but I figured it would be ok.

As the port came into sight, I could see white water near the entrance.  Now I love white water and waves if it's the Caribbean and I'm playing on the beach, but a bit less thrilled when I'm on a yacht headed in their direction.  But my concerns were groundless, the waves were hitting the outside of the harbour wall, the approach itself was fine.  What I wasn't expecting however, was that after 5 hours of sailing without seeing another boat, the harbour entrance was littered with lots of small motor boats fishing.  It was like an obstacle course.

Having got through the obstacle course I'm now anchored in the Baia de Sao Jacinto, near to a village of that name.  It's the only place I can stop in this area. The guide talks of anchoring in the NE corner, but these days it's full of local moorings.  I managed to anchor on the edge of those moorings.  The village looks pretty, in front of me, but the view behind is rather more industrial.  I'll just have to keep blinkers on.  Should I wish to visit Aveiro, I can get a ferry from the village.
