# Figueira de Foz to Nazaré

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/sb090g8w.jpg)

Wednesday arrives and back comes the sun and a favourable wind for sailing.  This time the target is Nazaré, about 35 nm south.

But first, some domestic work.  I decided to use the 'laundry' at the marina.  The laundry turned out to be one domestic washing machine plumbed into a cupboard, with a locked cupboard door to control access. No drying facilities and a €6 charge.  The lack of drying facilities delayed my departure until about 12.30, but now I understand why the ropes used to control the front sail are known as 'sheets'.  It's where I pegged my 'sheets' to dry!

There's little I can say about the trip.  It was fast, a bit rolly, but mainly comfortable, clear blue sky, sunshine, and warm to hot.  It was what sailing should always be like, but rarely is.

With the aid of the favourable ocean currents (as opposed to tides - I was corrected by the gentleman in charge of the marina here) and favourable winds, I did the trip in about 5.5 hrs, but the wind had picked up to a F5 gusting 6 by my arrival.  There was one berth left, which was an easy park as the wind blew me on to it and Mick off Tanqueray Bay (the Gosport boat from Aveiro) was there to take my lines.

The marina is run by an English couple, perhaps best described as 'past the first flush of youth'.  Unfortunately Mick described the Capitainaire as the image of Uncle Albert off  'Fools and Horses'.  This was unfortunate as Uncle Albert was very pleasant and very helpful and informative.  But all I seemed to be able to think of was, yes, you've guessed, Uncle Albert.

Formalities complete, it's time for G&T and olives.  A great day.
