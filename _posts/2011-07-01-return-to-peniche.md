# Caiscas to Peniche

*Peniche ![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/anchor-small_scale.jpg)*

Friday morning and time to face the start of the trip north.  To be honest, this bit of the trip I had not been looking forward to.  The winds mainly blow south, and the atlantic current flows south to match. But unless I leave the boat here (tempting) north I must go.

I planned to hug the coast much closer than before, and pushed my comfort envelope by mainly staying about 0.25 - 0.35 nm off shore, compared to the 3-5 nm on way south.  It worked a treat and kept me out of most of the current, with the odd favourable eddy.  The winds were very light as expected apart from the odd gusting up near some headlands.  I had a few goes at sailing, but essentially motored all the way.

As ever it seems, as I approached my destination, the wind got up.  But this time it was more extreme, as I think a couple weather fronts passed through.

There had also been several grumblings of thunder, and some interesting cloud formations.  In fact it would have been perfect for yachtmaster weather training, as the classic signs of a warm front then cold front passed by, followed by the inevitable squally conditions that brings. The wind instrument recorded over 50 knots at one point, though I suspect it was having a bit of fit, and may only have been 40 odd. There was about 30 mins struggling with the strong winds of the weather system, but now (about 10 mins ago) back to blue sky and sunshine, the 1st all day.

I didn't plan on spending any time at Peniche so anchored just outside the harbour entrance and next to the beach.  It was a little 'rolly' but ok.
