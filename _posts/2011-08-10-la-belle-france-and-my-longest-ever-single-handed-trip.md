# Gijon (Spain) to La Rochelle (France

*Biscay ![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img_1182-sml_scale.jpg)*

The big day arrived.  I have been in Spain for several weeks, and it really is time to wrench myself away.  So Monday 8 August, I set off from Gijon after topping up my fuel, bound for La Rochelle.

I'd estimated the trip would take about 2 days/48 hrs, which was the longest trip I'd ever contemplated single handed.  This made me a little tense, but as I'm now writing this, clearly I survived.  I set off around midday, thinking that would allow me to be up to 6 hrs early and still have daylight if faster than expected, or if slower, which seemed more likely based on wind forecasts,  9 hrs of daylight to be late in.

The photo had to be a Biscay sunset really, there's nothing else to take pictures of.  There were some pilot whales, but sadly they didn't hang around long enough.

The wind was in a perfect direction (I don't often write that!) for White Angel, and a decent strength, allowing full sail and top speeds, but the seas were very big. Its usual to look out to the side of the boat and look down on the sea.  At the start of the trip I knew the seas were big, as when I looked, all I could see was a huge wall of water, and I had to lift my eyes and head to see the top. It was a little disconcerting, but because the waves were not that steep or close together, it was not uncomfortable.

Eventually, after about 12 hrs or so the seas moderated to channel crossing standards and later became even flatter. The wind speed dropped off a bit sometimes during the latter part of the trip, but never to the point that the engine was needed.  Nor did it change direction as forecast.

In fact the trip was sufficiently comfortable to prepare meals like chicken and vegetables from scratch on one day, and pork chops with fresh vegetables on another.  It was a much better trip than I could have hoped for.

The result of the great weather was a much faster crossing than expected, but the downside of arriving at about 04.00, which of course is in the dark.  And this was not just 'the dark', but it was black, as the very bright moon which lit the early part of the night had also gone to bed.  This arrival in the dark was easily the worst part of the trip.

I had hoped to anchor at the bottom of the Isle de Ré and go in to the centre of La Rochelle with the afternoon high tide.  However, the anchorage didn't seem that settled, and I could see nothing!  So I decided to follow the chart plotter and lit marker buoys to the outer marina at Minemes.

My pilot book said it's manned 24 hrs, which was great, as I was really pretty tired by now, and would have welcomed a hand.  I called them on the radio using various pronunciations of Minemes, but all to no avail, or certainly no reply.

I went into the dimly lit marina and saw the reception/waiting pontoon, and there was one space left, barely big enough for the boat.  But after 3 attempts at trying to park the boat in that space, I had to give up. Each time I got to the pontoon, the tide gently slide the boat away again before I could get ashore.  I could probably have managed if the space was bigger, if there was daylight and perhaps not so tired. But after 3rd time unlucky, I gave up and just went and  berthed at another vacant pontoon - 1st try.

So after 1 and 2/3 days, on Wednesday morning, I completed my 1st single handed Biscay crossing, logging 277 nm, and was certainly glad to arrive.
