# Povoa de Varzim

*Its not supposed to be a screwdriver holding it together* [![povoa 02 mast]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/povoa-02-mast.jpg)](http://digicasts.org/whiteangel/2012/12/problems-at-povoa/povoa-02-mast/)

Taking a few days off seemed a good time to catch up with a couple of things that needed attending to on the boat.  So on Thursday, that's what I did.

Firstly was renewing the flag halyards (the bits of string used to fly courtesy flags or any other type of signal flags).  The originals no longer fitted following the new mast being installed, and had a temporary fix of an extra bit of string tied on.  The challenge was to get the new longer string through a mast fitting about 10m high.

It turned out to be straightforward.  I sewed one end of the new string to the end of the old string, and simply pulled the new string through.  Great.

Buoyed by this success, I decided to tackle another problem.  When the boom was re-fitted by the riggers, 2 washers used to position the fitting where the boom ajoins the mast had been fitted to the top rather than the bottom of a steel vertical rod.  The rod would go where the screwdriver is in the picture.  The result of that was that a fitting on the boom was grinding against a fitting on the mast.

'All' that was needed, was to remove the pin, take the washers out and refit with the washers at the bottom.  The fittings would then be clear of each other.  Simple - I thought.

It proved quite difficult to get the pin out, as the fittings are under some pressure from the weight of the boom and sail.  But after much grunting and banging, I got the pin and washers out, and succeeded in getting the washers in the right place, and the pin ¾ re-inserted.  At this point the banging attracted my neighbour's interest, who I'll simply refer to as G, who then joined the fun to help.

With G at the mast, and me in the cockpit using various ropes and winches to position the boom to allow the pin to get to the right position, I heard a bang, and as readers of this blog will know by now, bangs are not a good noise to hear on a boat.   I looked up in time to see that stainless steel pin, that I now know to be 118mm long and 12mm in diameter, arc gracefully through the air, as if in slow motion, before diving elegantly into 6.2m of water and silt next to the boat.

Sh\*t!

Without the pin, the boom was not secure, and not only could the boat not be sailed, it would be unwise to motor, for fear of the boom jumping from its position and causing damage.

Needless to say, the pin is not a stock item in chandleries, let alone the very limited chandler here.  A rigger might have one, but there are none here.  Things were not looking good.

G came up with the cunning plan of getting a diver who 'owes me a favour', to go and have a look.  Plan B was to engage with the local services to see if the part could be manufactured locally (but not that day as 'the man' was away in Lisbon), and Plan C to locate the part in the UK and have it sent out.  All time consuming stuff.  It was starting to look as if I might be here for some time.

Mind you, looking at the surf outside in relatively light winds does not encourage me to rush out. **[![povoa 03 surf]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/povoa-03-surf.jpg)](http://digicasts.org/whiteangel/2012/12/problems-at-povoa/povoa-03-surf/)

Friday morning came along with the diver.  A ex-special forces diver apparently.  He free-dived (that means snorkel rather than tank), but sadly his special forces didn't help him find the part.  He said he'd try again Saturday with an oxygen tank to allow more time for sifting through the silted bottom.  Time for Plan B.   I spoke to a local company who said they'd come and measure up in the afternoon, but couldn't comment on timescales, and of course the next day was a Saturday......

Joining the diver was a collection of fish.  It would be easier to imagine the boat is berthed in a fish farm than there are some fish swimming around in the marina.

Time for Plan C in parallel.  I spoke to the UK riggers that fitted the mast, who were very helpful, and ready to post the part to me.  It was then a spark fired in my mind, and I remembered that when fitting the boom, the riggers had used the original boom fitting as it was both hard to get off, and perfectly serviceable, and had given me the new fitting.  Could that fitting have perhaps included the much needed pin?

Amazingly I went straight to where I'd stored the fitting (if only I could remember where I leave things at home with such ease).  And there in the bag was the most highly desired and rare piece of stainless in steel in Povoa de Varzim - the pin I needed.

With all other plans now cancelled, apart from the diver who is still thinking of diving just for the challenge, I fitted the new pin, and am ready to go.

Friday afternoon brought rain and fog, the 1st rain since i've been on the Iberian peninsular, but within ½ a day it was gone, and today, Saturday, it's blue sky and sunshine once more, and time to leave the lovely church and tidiest graveyard I've ever seen.

*Out and about in Povoa de Varzim*
