# Viveiro to Ribadeo

I couldn't help but think "will the mast get under there?"  despite the mast clearing by about 10m!

After a good night, time for an early'ish start.  The wind has often seemed to be light to non-existent in the morning, picking up in the afternoon to healthy blow just when I'm parking. So the first part was a leisurely motor on flat seas, allowing the creation of a tasty, but possibly not that healthy, bacon and cheese sandwich.

When the wind did pick up, it allowed an excellent sail by not being particularly strong, calm'ish seas and only a little tacking.  So a pretty good trip of about 35nm to the very attractive Ria de Ribadeo. The entrance to the Ria is dominated by a spectacular bridge.

Sadly there was no-where suitable for anchoring due to shallow depths and shifting sand banks, so into the marina I went.

After tying up, the marinero (marina assistant), who had obviously been watching, turned up to tell me to report to the office.  This was fair enough I thought at the time, but felt somewhat aggrieved when I later saw him help another boat berth that had 7, yes SEVEN, people on board. The offence was compounded when they directed me to another berth with the same lack of assistance.  It would be unfair to say the marina staff were rude, but they certainly could not be described as friendly and helpful, which was so untypical of my experiences at every other marina in Spain and Portugal.

My love of this marina only continued to deteriorate as it was the most expensive to date at about €40, and was not very comfortable as the allocated berth suffered from the wash of passing craft.  The icing on the cake came about 30 mins after midnight when the boat shook.  I wondered if I'd been hit by something.  But no, investigation showed I was aground.  The marina that charged so much for so little put me in a berth that didn't have enough water by about 0.2m.

All this was a shame as the Ria looked very attractive, and the old town had lots of character and looked potentially interesting, but not worth the marina charges or lack of depth for another night.
