# Piriac Sur Mer to Lorient

*The Boat Cemetary ![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img_1238-sml_scale.jpg)*

I was up bright and early, well early anyway, to get out of the marina at high water.

I'd intended to go to Houat, another island anchorage, followed by Lorient. But the weather was perfect for sailing.  It was light to moderate winds, flat seas, warm and sunny.  In fact it felt so good, I simply didn't want to stop at Houat, and carried on sailing and sunbathing all the way to Lorient, a 45 nm trip.

At Lorient, I'd arranged to meet John, an old friend who has hung up his sailing boots in favour of a motor caravan, who was touring the area. This did mean I'd arrived a day early, but it was worth it.

At Lorient I was lucky enough to get a finger pontoon, rather than having to raft next to other boats which I'm not keen on.  Or so I thought!  Shortly after arriving, a small aluminium ship took the berth next to me.  It was about 42 foot, but very wide and high sided, but more significantly nearly crushed my poor boat as it attempted to squeeze in.  The 1st I knew of it was when I saw the feet of the harbour master appear on my side decks before he ran to the front to push the monster away, joined very quickly by me.  Somehow the thing parked, with lots of pushing to prevent it gouging lumps out of my boat.

The next day it left with less drama, and I relaxed.  But about an hr or so later, I see that John has arrived, but curiously gone straight on to the deck. It turns out another boat not skilled in parking was about to ram my boat, and John bravely saved the day.  I think his version says the front of my boat was about to be ripped off, and thanks to his superhuman strength he managed to avoid the collision by about a cigarette paper width.  But he did save the day, so thanks very much John.  I was so lucky that he happened to arrive when he did.

A pleasant and convivial few days followed, with some good food, and a trip to boat cemetery.  A first for me.
