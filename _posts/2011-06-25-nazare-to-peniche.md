# Nazaré to Peniche

*Peniche* ![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/small-peniche01_scale.jpg)

Friday - yet another fine day, and a moderate wind.

Uncle Albert came round to give me the met office forecast and recommended an anchorage at an island called Berlenga.  Off I set with the winds F4-6 on the stern quarter.  It was excellent sail to the island, but sadly the anchorage did not seem nearly enough settled to contemplate an overnight stop, so on to Peniche.

Peniche gets a discouraging write up in the pilot book, warning of swell as fishing boats speed past the 5-6 boat length visitors pontoon ignoring the 3 knt speed limit.  It also suggested that in the unlikely event it was possible, the inside of the pontoon would be better.

As ever, when its time to park, the wind picks up and today was no exception!  As I entered the harbour, a French yacht cut the corner to nip in, and get in front of me, and then took the last remaining space on the pontoon.  I imagine he was very pleased with himself.

However, he could not have been nearly as pleased as me when I spotted a space on the rarely available inside which he had either not seen in his rush to grab the apparent last spot, or not read about the benefits.

It was a challenging park, with a strong wind blowing me off the pontoon, but thanks to some shoreside help, I did it.  It is a very much better spot.  The boat moves a little when the fishing boats race past as if to get a last pint before closing time, but nothing compared to the bucking of the outer boats.

I tried hard not to be smug - but failed.
