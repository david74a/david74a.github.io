# Aveiro to Figueira de Foz

*Fog ![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/small-img_0931_scale.jpg)*

Tuesday morning dawns, but the sun stays in bed.  It's quite thick fog with little wind.  Ugh, and I was up uncharacteristically early to exit the lagoon ang get the tides just right.  I figured (hoped) that given all the sunshine I'd been suffering, the fog would burn off as the day warmed up.  So at 07.15, radar on, anchor up and away.

I motored out of the lagoon and into the river, relying on the chart plotter and radar, as I couldn't see enough to navigate by.  Coming down the river, I could see the misty bank I was nearest to, but not the other side.  Despite this, the locals were still out creating an obstacle course by floating about in their small open boats fishing - no fancy radar or chart plotter for them, just bravery or stupidity.

I cleared the river and got out to sea.  Sadly the fog never really cleared until I had literally entered the bay of my destination Figueira de Foz, and then I could see the fog bank behind me.  Occasionally the fog seemed to clear a bit above me providing a peek of blue sky, but never around me.  However, on rounding the last headland, it eased enough to provide the above photo opportunity.  But essentially it was a 7 hr trip in grey/white nothingness, staring at a chart and radar screen from Aveiro to Figueira de Foz.

The marina was ok, but at €30 a night seemed expensive compared to the others, and for worse facilities.  There was a local enclosed market nearby selling fresh fruit and vegetables, bread, cheeses, as well as fish and meat.  I haven't yet plucked up the courage to risk the butchers, but I did get some fruit to keep the scurvy away.
