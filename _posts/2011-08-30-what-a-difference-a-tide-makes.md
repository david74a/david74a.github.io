# l'Aberbendoit to Morgueriec

I hoped to make substantial progress homewards today, ideally Perros Guirec, but the wind and tides had other ideas.  It's spring tides, and not just an ordinary spring but both higher and lower than usual.  This meant I couldn't leave when I wanted, but had to wait for sufficient water to leave the mooring, which turned out to be 2.30 pm.  I could have left at about 10.30, but that would have given me a strong tide against me. Given that the wind was also against me, tacking into a strong foul tide simply isn't an option, so 2.30 pm it was.

Given the conditions, it would have been after midnight had I pushed on to Perros Guirec, and even then the marina would not have been open to me as it is only open 1 hr either side of high water, so Perros Guirec was off the menu.  After studying the charts I spotted a little known anchorage at Morgueriec that I'd never noticed before, and decided to try that.

I edged out of the l'Aberbendoit estuary, which is a narrow route that involves lots of course changes to avoid unforgiving rocks. Fortunately I'd done my sums correctly, and the depth went no lower than 1.2m beneath the keel, but this bit was not comfortable.

At sea, I set the sails and commenced the tacking towards Morgueriec.  The seas were strangely flat for most of the trip, just getting lumpy for the last hour.  I say strangely, as there was a moderate wind, enough to warrant one reef, and it was wind against a strong tide.  These are the classic conditions for rough seas.  I spent a few hours recording between 8-9 knots over the ground which helped reduced what should have been a 6 hour trip to 4.5 hrs.

Using the tide makes such a difference.

The sun was out, so mostly a good day, but there is a definite feel that the summer is over, as the air was noticeably cooler. The decision has changed from whether or not to wear a swimming costume to whether or not to wear a fleece.  More evidence of getting nearer home I guess.

The anchorage was fine, possibly a little bland, though subject to a bit of swell which didn't make for the best of nights, but nonetheless better than the alternative.
