# Muros to Muxia

*The uninhabited marina* ![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/muxia02_scale.jpg)

After a pleasant couple of days at Muros, where I met another lone sailor hailing from Yarmouth who comes here every year, it was time to move on.

The winds were light, and had gone around to the south and west.  That sounded ok for me travelling north, but wind from the north = sun;  wind from the south = fog.  This trip was no exception.

I motor sailed in damp fog and occasional drizzle past the famous (or infamous) Finisterre, where the sea got quite churned up despite the lack of strong winds.  I was very aware that it was off this bit of coast some 5 years ago I encounter winds over 50 knots, and the biggest seas I've ever seen in over 20 years of sailing.  So it was with a sense of relief I saw a misty Finisterre lighthouse slip by and disappear in the murk behind me.

About 5.5 hrs later I arrived in the rain it Muxia.  There is a new marina here, completed in 2010.  However, I'm told no-one has been found to take responsibility for the multi million pound investment and run it.  I tied up for a free night in the virtually empty marina.  There was no water or electricity or wi-fi, but nor was there on my previous 4 nights at anchor, so I thought I could cope.

I wanted to go ashore, but the gate was locked.  Fortunately a friendly local showed me how to disable the lock, asking me to lock it properly when I left.  That sentence implies a discussion, but actually it was more pigeon English and signing than discussion, but I think we both got the idea, and I was very grateful.  Muxia seemed a nice town, and would, I suspect have been quite pretty in the sun.  But it did the job for a rest after the trip.  Sunshine due back tomorrow.
